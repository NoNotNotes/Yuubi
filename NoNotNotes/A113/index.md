Finally revisiting the fundamentals of nursing. There's a new book being used other than Kozier and Erb's, but it might stay as my main reference for now. The presentations I'm going to be using for this are made by Ma'am Tuiza, and those are based off of the Fundamentals of Nursing book by DeLaune.
