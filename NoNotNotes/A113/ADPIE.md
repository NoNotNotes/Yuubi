The **Nursing Process**, a systematic scientific method of formulating and providing nursing care generally consists of five core steps, summarized by the mnemonic **ADPIE**. In order, they are **Assessment**, **Diagnosis**, **Planning**, **Intervention/Implementation**, and **Evaluation**.
___
# Assessment
Assessment is the first step of the nursing process.  There are **four major activities** to do during the assessment phase: **collection**, **organization**, **validation**, and **documentation** of data. Assessment aims to determine **client health status** prior to, during, and after nursing and medical interventions. Assessment can be done in various settings, and can by typed as such:

| Based on Timing                | Function                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Initial Assessment**         | Done **after admission** to establish a **complete database** for problem identification, reference, and future comparison.             |
| **Problem-Focused Assessment** | **Ongoing process** integrated with nursing care to **determine the status** of a specific problem identified in an earlier assessment. |
| **Emergency Assessment**       | Done during any **physiologic or psychologic crisis** of the client to identify **life-threatening, new, or overlooked problems**.      |
| **Time-Lapsed Reassessment**   | Done **several months after** initial assessment to **compare** the client's status to baseline data previously obtained.               |

| Based on Focus               | Function                                                            |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Comprehensive Assessment** | A complete assessment and health history performed upon admission.  |
| **Focused Assessment**       | Assessment focused on a particular need or healthcare problem.      |
| **Ongoing Assessment**       | Systematic monitoring and observation related to specific problems. |
## Data Collection
This function of assessment aims to **gather information** about a client's health status. The end goal product of this step is to produce a **database**, which contains all the information about a client. This process aims to be **systematic and continuous** to prevent the omission of significant data and to reflect a client's *changing* health status. There are various categories of data collected:
1. **Nursing Health History**
	- **Biographic Data**
	- **Chief Complaint**
	- **Past History**: illness, immunization, allergies
	- **Family History of Illness**
	- **Lifestyle**: personal habits, diet, sleep pattern
	- **Social Data**: ethnic affiliation, educational and occupational history
	- **Psychologic Data**: stressors, coping pattern
	- **Patterns of Healthcare**: ophthalmologist, gynecologist, dentist
2. **Physical Assessment**
3. **Primary Care Provider's History**
4. **Physical Examination**
5. **Results of Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests**
6. **Material Contributed by Other Health Personnel**
### Data Types

| Data Type           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Subjective Data** | *Symptoms* **felt by the patient**, which can only be described or verified solely by the patient. These are **covert data** such as itching, pain, feelings of worry, feelings, values, beliefs, and attitudes. |
| **Objective Data**  | *Signs* **observed or measured by the examiner**, often tested against accepted standards. These are **overt data** such as discoloration of the skin, blood pressure, vital signs, etc.                         |
| **Constant Data**   | Data that **do not change over time** such as ethnicity and blood type.                                                                                                                                          |
| **Variable Data**   | Data that is **subject to change over time**, even acutely, such as that of pain, blood pressure, and height.                                                                                                    |
| **Primary Data**    | Data obtained directly from the client or source. This is often the most reliable source.                                                                                                                        |
| **Secondary Data**  | Data obtained anywhere other than from the client. All secondary sources should be validated when possible. This includes family members or other support persons, health professionals, records, and reports.   |

### Data Sources and Collection Methods
1. **Client**: usually the **best source of data** except in cases of illness, young patients, or patients too confused to communicate clearly. Some clients cannot or do not with to provide accurate data. In these cases, family members or significant others can be sources of secondary data.
>[!TIP] R.A. 10173: Data Privacy Act of 2012
>You can remind the client of Data Privacy if they are hesitant about the safety of their information. The **Data Privacy Act** mandates the protection of all privileged client information from those not involved in their care. Additionally, the **Nurses Code of Ethics** and **Patients' Bill of Rights** place privacy and confidentiality as important aspects of data handling.
2. **Support People**: family members, friends, and caregivers who can give information on the client's **response to illness**, the client's **stressors**, family attitudes on illness and health, and the client's **home environment**. As mentioned, they are especially important for very young, unconscious, or confused clients. Information, if obtained from support systems, should be notated as such.
3. **Client Records**: documented information by various healthcare professionals, including medical records, records of therapies, and laboratory records.
4. **Healthcare Professionals**: nurses, social workers, and primary care providers can share information to ensure the **continuity of care** when clients are transferred to and from home and healthcare agencies.
5. **Literature**: professional journals and reference texts can be used as basis for care. Literature needs to be **reviewed** when used, including the comparison of findings to the current standards, comparison to cultural and social health practices, spiritual beliefs, and the assessment data needed for specific client conditions.

The nurse is able to obtain data with three main methods:
1. **Observing**: the nurse utilizes their **senses** and specialized knowledge to obtain data about the patient. The process of observation is systematic to avoid oversights:
	- **Clinical Signs** are checked, particularly of **distress**. This includes pallor, labored breathing, and behaviors indicating pain.
	- **Threats to Safety** are determined, including both present and foreseeable risks. A common example of this is a lowered siderail.
	- **Equipment** are also maintained and checked if they are properly functioning and configured. Examples include IV sets, oxygen tanks, monitors, and ventilators.
	- **Environment**: many environmental factors can affect health and quality of life. Even minor, non-lethal factors such as lighting, cleanliness, and the people in the client's immediate environment are considered.

| Sense Used  | Client Data Obtained                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Vision**  | Overall appearance (body size, posture, grooming)<br>Signs of distress or discomfort<br>Facial and body gestures<br>Skin color and lesions<br>Religious or cultural artifacts (books, icons, candles, beads) |
| **Smell**   | Body or breath odors, especially in discharges and wounds.                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Hearing** | Lung and heart sounds<br>Bowel sounds<br>Ability to communicate<br>Language spoken<br>Orientation to time, person and place                                                                                  |
| **Touch**   | Skin temperature and moisture<br>Muscle strength (via hand grip)<br>Pulse rate, rhythm, and volume<br>Palpable lesions (lumps, masses, nodules)                                                              |
2. **Interviewing**: communication planned and carried out with a purpose, such as for a nursing health history. Two common approaches are used: **direct** (highly structured, specific) and **non-directive** (rapport-building, the client is allowed to control the purpose, subject matter, and pacing).
	- **Closed Questions**: short, direct questions seeking factual answers. "*What medications have you taken today?*" "*Are you having pain now?*"
	- **Open-ended Questions**: questions that elaborate, clarify, or illustrate their thoughts or feelings. Non-directive. "*How have you been feeling lately?*" "*What brought you to the hospital?*"
	- **Neutral Questions**: open-ended, non-pressuring questions. Non-directive. "*How did you feel about that?*" "*What do you think led to the operation?*"
	- **Leading Questions**: questions that direct client answers. Directive. "*You will take your medicine, won't you?*" "*You're stressed for the upcoming surgery, aren't you?*"
>[!INFO] Planning an Interview
>An interview should be planned according to:
>1. **Time**: the client should be comfortable and free of pain, with little opportunity for interruptions.
>2. **Place**: well-lit, well-ventilated rooms that are free of noise and distractions should be used as much as possible.
>3. **Seating Arrangement**: the nurse positions themselves at a 45° angle to the bed. This makes it more familiar than sitting behind a table or standing at the foot of the bed, while maintaining a professional distance.
>4. **Distance**: an appropriate distance of **2 to 3 feet** is used during an interview.
>5. **Language**: the nurse takes care to convert medical terms to common language; at the level of the client's educational attainment.
>6. **Flow**: the interview consists of an **opening** (introduction, rapport, orientation), **body** (questioning, answering), and **closing** (clarifications, conclusions/summary, termination, and future planning if necessary).
3. **Physical Examination**: the application of **inspection**, **palpation**, **percussion**, and **auscultation** (*mn. IPPA*), carried out systematically, often in an organized (head-to-toe; **cephalocaudal**, and **body systems approach**).
## Organizing Data
Nurses organize data in a written or electronic format to systematically organize assessment data. A common framework for organization was made by **Marjory Gordon** as **Gordon's 11 Functional Health Patterns**:

| Functional Health Pattern                   | Contents                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| **Elimination**                             | Excretion patterns that need to be evaluated, such as constipation, incontinence, and diarrhea. The excretion itself should also be examined for color and consistency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Activity-Exercise**                       | Whether one is able to perform daily activities normally without any problem. This includes feeding, bathing, toileting, dressing, grooming, etc. There are generally four levels of functionality:<br>- Level I: requires equipment/device use.<br>- Level II: requires assistance or supervision from another person.<br>- Level III: both I and II<br>- Level IV: is dependent and does not participate. |
| **Cognitive-Perceptual**                    | Neurological function; the person's ability to comprehend information. This includes hearing, vision, memory, decision-making, learning, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Roles-Relationships**                     | Family conditions, problems, dependencies, etc. Only obtained if necessary for the patient's age and specific situation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Self-Perception/Self-Concept**            | How does the patient describe themself? Self-image, satisfaction with the self and/or body (esp. after illness or disability), etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Coping-Stress**                           | Any stressors, persistent stress/anxiety levels, the use of medications, drugs, or alcohol. Commonly used coping mechanisms and their success are recorded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Value-Belief**                            | Religion, spirituality, future plans, etc. The most important consideration is if religious practices may interfere with healthcare or vice versa.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| **Nursing Physical Assessment**             | Biophysical data, vital signs, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
## Validating Data
Data, as much as possible, and especially secondary data, is **validated to ensure accuracy**; basically, *double-checking* the data to ensure accuracy. Generally, data can be considered as **cues** which are **signs and symptoms**, and **inferences**, which are further **interpretations and conclusions** based on the cues.
>[!ERROR] Faulty inferences can result from jumping to conclusions or focusing in the wrong direction.

There are some types of data that do not require validation. These include things such as height, weight, birth dates, and most laboratory studies. However, those that do require validation are data that **need to be correlated with the client's physical or emotional behavior**, and data **found to have discrepancies** obtained in the nursing interview (subjective data) and the physical examination (objective data), or when the client's statements shift between assessments. The following are examples of validating data:
1. **Comparing subjective and objective data**: the statement of "*I'm feeling hot*" warrants the nurse to check the patient's body temperature.
2. **Clarify statements**: statements are clarified if they are ambiguous or vague. "*I felt sick on and off for six weeks*" warrants the nurse to clarify: "*Describe what your sickness is like. What does on and off mean?*"
3. **Cues, not inferences**: data is based on cues and not inferences. For example, the observation of **dry skin and poor skin turgor** (tenting) produces an inference of **dehydration**. Furthermore, additional data is obtained to support any inferences made, if necessary. In the previous example, the nurse would then obtain data on the client's fluid intake, amount and appearance of urine, and blood pressure. If these also correlate as signs of dehydration, the inference is strengthened.
4. **Double-check abnormal data**: all abnormal, especially those of extreme abnormality, is double checked. For example, an abnormal blood pressure reading of 210/95 mm Hg is double-checked with another sphygmomanometer and/or by another nurse.
5. **Check for interference**: many factors can interfere with accurate measurement. The nurse checks for potential sources of abnormality before measuring. For example, a crying infant will often display an abnormal respiratory rate. In this case, the finding is not representative of the infant's actual respiratory status, and quieting of the infant is required before an accurate assessment can be made.
6. **Use references**: phenomena may be explained using information from reputable textbooks, journals, and research reports. For example, a geriatric patient with a tiny purple/blue-black swollen area under the tongue is normal according to literature stating such physical changes (sublingual varices) are normal with aging.
## Documenting Data
The nurse completes assessment by recording client data. All data are recorded **factually** rather than interpretatively. This data can be used for the following steps of the nursing process, and should not change in meaning when written down. For example, a client's morning meal is recorded literally: "*Client consumed 240 mL coffee, 120 mL juice, 1 egg, and 1 slide of toast"* rather than "*Client appetite is good.*" (a judgment)

# Diagnosis
Nursing diagnosis entails **problem identification**. It is a **clinical judgment about the client's responses to actual and potential health problems or life processes**. It is based on critical analysis of assessment data and identified client strengths and problems. In contemporary standards, the **[North American Nursing Diagnosis Association](https://nanda.org/)** (NANDA) for nursing diagnoses. A nursing diagnosis can focus on different types of problems:

| Type                           | Description                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Actual nursing diagnosis**   | **Problem-based**. A problem **present at the time of assessment**. Ex.: "*Altered respiratory status*", "*Impaired ability to cope*"                       |
| **Health promotion diagnosis** | Client **preparedness to improve** health condition. Ex.: "*Willingness to learn about the health maintenance*", "*Willingness to change health practices*" |
| **Risk nursing diagnosis**     | **Problem-based**, for problems **not yet present** but whose **risk factors are present**. Ex.: "*Risk for or Potential for impaired breathing patterns*"  |
| **Syndrome diagnosis**         | **Syndromes** are a set of similar nursing diagnoses that occur together, and can be resolved with similar interventions. Ex.: "*Chronic Pain Syndrome*"    |
| **Wellness diagnosis**         | A state of **health** that may be further **enhanced** by health promoting activities. Ex.: "*Readiness of enhanced spiritual wellbeing*"                   |
>[!WARNING] vs. Medical Diagnoses
>Medical diagnoses name the disease at hand, its pathology, and does not describe *human responses*. As long as the disease remains, this diagnosis does not change. In contrast, nursing diagnoses describe human responses to the disease *process* or health problem. These change throughout the disease process and can change frequently.
## Components of a Nursing Diagnosis
1. **Problem**: the **health problem**, **response**, or **status** of the patient. These are paired with **qualifiers** that add context to the problem. These are words such as "*Deteriorated*", "*Vulnerable to threat*", "*Incomplete*". These are **diagnostic labels** that direct the formation of client goals and desired outcomes.
2. **Etiology**: one or more **probably causes of the health problem**, giving direction to required nursing therapy. These specify the health problem to the individual at hand, providing client-centered care.
3. **Signs and Symptoms**: **clusters of signs and symptoms** that indicate the presence of a particular diagnostic label. These are used for actual nursing diagnoses, and are not available for risk nursing diagnoses.
## Diagnostic Process
1. **Analyze Data**: collect and compare significant assessment cues against standards. Cluster these cues for a tentative hypothesis, and identify gaps and inconsistencies (conflicting or erroneous data).
2. **Identify Health Problems, Risks, or Strengths**
3. **Formulate Diagnostic Statement**: using the components of the nursing diagnosis to create a one-part, two-part, or three-part diagnosis:
	- **One-part Statement**: only the problem (nursing diagnosis) is stated, with no etiology or signs/symptoms necessary. Ex.: "*Readiness for enhanced community coping*".
	- **Two-part Statement**: the problem and its etiology, often used for risk statements, as patients do not yet have signs and symptoms. Ex.: "*Non-adherence (diabetic diet) **related to** denial of having disease*", "*Anxiety **related to** threat to physiologic integrity: possible cancer diagnosis*"
	- **Three-part Statement**: a full statement of the three components of a nursing diagnosis. Ex.: "*Impaired self-esteem **related to** feelings of rejection by husband **as manifested by** hypersensitivity to criticism; states "I don't know if I can manage by myself" and rejects positive feedback*".
## Writing a Nursing Diagnosis
1. State a **problem**, not a **need**: `Alteration in fluid` rather than `Fluid replacement`.
2. Word the statement so that it is **legally advisable**; avoid "*incriminatory*" statements that predispose the nurse to complaints: `Altered skin integrity related to improper positioning` insinuates that the problem is caused by negligent care → `Altered skin integrity related to immobility`
3. Use **non-judgmental statements**: `Impaired spirituality related to inability to attend church services secondary to immobility` rather than `Impaired spirituality related to strict rules necessitating church attendance`.
4. **Avoid redundancy** between the problem and etiology: `Altered skin integrity related to ulceration of sacral area` is a self-referencing diagnosis. Instead, write `Potential for altered skin integrity related to immobility`.
5. Ensure correctness of the **cause-and-effect relationship**: `Pain related to headache` is invalid as the headache does not cause pain; it is pain itself. Instead, `Pain: severe headache related to avoidance of narcotics due to fear of addiction` provides an appropriate etiological statement.
6. Word the diagnosis **specifically** and **precisely**: `Alteration in mucous membrane integrity related to noxious agent` identifies the etiology, but does not specify the type of interventions potentially required. Instead, `Alteration in mucous membrane integrity related to decreased salivation secondary to radiation of neck` can point nurses to the proper interventions to use.
7. Use **nursing terminology** rather than medical terminology to describe the client's response: `Potential for pneumonia` is medical in nature; `Potential for altered respiratory status related to accumulation of secretions in lungs` better fits a nurse's field of knowledge. Similarly, etiologies should also use nursing terminology: `...related to accumulation of secretion in lungs` rather than `...related to pneumonia`.

# Planning
**Planning** involves **designing nursing activities**. It is required to prevent, reduce, or eliminate a client's health problems through an intentional, systematic process of decision-making and problem-solving. It utilizes the client's **assessment data** and **diagnostic statements** for direction in formulating **client goals** and designing nursing interventions.
>[!INFO] Nursing Care Plan
>The end product of this phase is a **Nursing Care Plan** (NCP). NCPs may be **standardized** (used for specific populations with predictable, common problems) and/or **individualized** (tailored to unique needs).

| Type of Planning       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Initial Planning**   | **Admission** assessment that develops the initial comprehensive plan of care that is **initiated as soon as possible**.                                                                                                              |
| **Ongoing Planning**   | Occurs at the beginning of **every shift** for determining required care for a nurse's shift. It determines:<br>- Changes in health status<br>- Set priorities and decide problems to focus on<br>- Coordinate the nurse's activities |
| **Discharge Planning** | The anticipation and planning for **client needs after discharge**. Effective discharge planning begins at first client contact.                                                                                                      |
## Creating NCPs
An NCP should contain aspects of **restoration** of health, **prevention** of disease, and **maintenance** of health. **On-going assessment** is also outlined for continual use of the care plan.
1. **Date and sign** the plan. This is done for evaluation, review, and future planning. **Accountability** is expressed with a signature.
2. **Category headings** are used to compartmentalize the pertinent entries for each phase of the nursing process.
3. **Use standardized, approved medical notation**. This keeps the plan succinct yet meaningful between members of the healthcare team.
	- Nurses may **refer to procedure books** rather than outline procedures within the plan itself, e.g., "*See unit procedure book for tracheostomy care.*"
4. **Be specific**. The details of an intervention (e.g., duration, time) is outlined comprehensively to assure proper compliance between shifts.
5. **Individualize**. Care is not always a stenciled activity. Client choices and preferences are considered when planning care.
6. **Multidisciplinary Coverage**: collaborative interventions should be used, adhering to the holistic aspect of care. Referrals to dietitians, occupational therapists, physicians, etc. are included in the care plan.
7. **Discharge Planning**: plans for discharge and home care needs should be included in the care plan.
## Planning Process
1. **Priority Setting**: the assignment of problems as **high**, **medium**, or **low priority**.

| Priority Level | Cases, Examples                                                                                                                                                                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **High**       | **Life-threatening**; impaired cardiopulmonary function<br>- Altered respiratory status (r/t secretions, pain, fatigue)<br>- Alteration in fluid volume (fluid loss r/t fever, diaphoresis) |
| **Medium**     | **Health-threatening**; acute illness and decreased coping ability<br>- Anxiety (r/t difficulty breathing)<br>- Concerns over work and parenting roles                                      |
| **Low**        | **Normal developmental needs**; requires minimal nursing support<br>- Impaired nutritional status (r/t anorexia, nausea, increased metabolism)<br>- Self-care deficit (r/t weakness)        |
2. **Establishing Client Goals/Desired Outcomes**: goals are *broad statements*, while *desired outcomes* are specific, measurable statements. Here are some examples:

| Diagnosis                                                                                                              | Goal                                                            | Desired Outcomes                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Alteration in mobility                                                                                                 | - Improved mobility<br>- Ability to bear weight on affected leg | - Ambulate with **crutches** by the end of the week<br>- **Stand** without assistance by the end of the month                                                                                        |
| Altered respiratory status<br>related to poor cough effort, secondary to incision pain<br>and fear of damaging sutures | - Effective airway clearance                                    | - Clear lungs upon auscultation during the entire postoperative period.<br>- No skin pallor or cyanosis by 12 hours postoperation.<br>- Demonstrate good cough effort within 24 hours postoperation. |
>[!INFO] Timespan
>Goals can be generally considered as **short-term** (within days or even hours), or **long-term** (within weeks or months).

3. **Selecting Nursing Interventions**:
	- **Independent interventions** are those activities which nurses are able to initiate on the basis of their knowledge and skills.
	- **Dependent interventions** are those carried out under the orders of a licensed physician.
	- **Collaborative interventions** are actions the nurse carries out with other health team members, such as physical therapists, social workers, and dietitians.
4. **Writing Individualized Nursing Interventions**: written interventions follow the **verb**-**condition/modifier**-**time element** format. For example:
	- Measure and record (*verb*) ankle circumference (*condition/modifier*) daily at 0900 (*time element*)
	- Apply (*verb*) spiral bandage firmly (*condition/modifier*) to left lower leg.
	- Assist (*verb*) client with tub bath (*condition/modifier*) daily at 0700 (*time element*)
## Delegation
The planned care may be **delegated** to those qualified, with supervision. It is the task of the delegator to determine the most appropriate and qualified delegees for the task. Certified nursing assistants (CNAs) and unlicensed assistive personnel (UAPs) are generally allowed to aid in positioning, feeding, recording of intake and output, ambulating, and vital signs (but not interpretation) and bathing. The following are **never delegated**:
1. **Unstable clients**: newly admitted patients, those returning from procedures, those post-operative, those with unstable vital signs, unstable blood sugar, and unstable neurological status
2. **Evaluation**: interpreting data, lab values, pain, and vital signs are all tasks of the nurse
3. **Assessment**: initial, first, primary assessment of the patient
4. **Teaching**: initial, first, primary education of the patient
___
# Implementation
The **action phase** in which the nurse performs **nursing interventions**. The client is reassessed to make sure the interventions are still valid, then care is provided. Requisite **assistance** is obtained for the procedure. During provision, **supervision** is imperative for delegated care. All nursing activities are **documented**.
1. **Reassessing the client** is done prior to care to determine if intervention is still required. This applies to independent and dependent actions, and the nurse exerts their clinical judgment as necessary.
2. **Determining the need for assistance** is done to perform care best provided collaboratively. This enhances safety and efficiency, especially in the case of a nurse who is not yet experienced in practice.
3. **Supervising delegated or assigned care** is a legal and ethical obligation under the doctrine of *respondeat superior*. All care activities must be implemented according to the care plan.
>[!TIP] **Respondeat Superior** is a doctrine of law to "*let the principal be held responsible*", extending the liability of subordinates to their superiors.
4. **Documenting Nursing Activities**: completion of the implementation phase occurs after **recording the interventions and client responses in the nursing progress notes**. This is done immediately after implementation, and **never** in advance.
## Good Characteristics of Nursing Interventions
- **Adaptable**: care is individualized to patient health status, beliefs, environment, etc.
- **Based on professional standards**: scientifically rational, with proper considerations and education on side effects and complications to watch out for.
- **Clear** and understandable; any questionable interventions are clarified and revised if erroneous.
- **Dignified**. The client's self-esteem is preserved as much as possible.
- **Encouraging** for the patient, especially in exercising independence, control, and active participation in their care.
- **Holistic**. It should be safe and **applied with teaching, support, and comfort**.
___
# Evaluation
The final phase of the nursing process. **Conclusions** are drawn whether or not the nursing interventions should be **terminated**, **continued**, or **changed**. There are five components of evaluation:

| Component                                      | Question                                                                            |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Collecting Data**                            | Has the client's condition improved or deteriorated since the last evaluation?      |
| **Comparing Data**                             | What improvements have been made in client care?                                    |
| **Relating Nursing Activities**                | Were the nursing interventions able to attain the planned outcomes?                 |
| **Drawing Conclusions**                        | Which outcomes have been attained?                                                  |
| **Continuation, Modification, or Termination** | Are there any changes necessary in the plan of care to attain the desired outcomes? |

1. **Collecting Data**: assessment of the client for the effects of implemented care. This follows the same principles as applied in the [[#Assessment]] phase.
2. **Comparing Data**: the re-assessment is compared to the data for desired outcomes. This is generally divided into three phrases in documentation: **Goal met**, **Goal partially met** (i.e., not all desired outcomes were reached), and **Goal not met**. These are followed by the assessment data supporting such a declaration.
3. **Relating Nursing Activities**: the interventions are correlated to the outcomes to determine their role in reaching goals. This determines if interventions are necessary, appropriate, effective, or efficient.
4. **Drawing Conclusions**: the previous steps compile into this final output. It concludes whether interventions should be continued, revised, or discontinued:

| Status                                                                                 | Further Action                                                                           |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Goal Met**: the problem has been resolved and its risk factors are no longer present | Care is discontinued                                                                     |
| **Goal Met**: the problem has been resolved but its risk factors remain present        | The care plan is kept for use when necessary.                                            |
| **Goal Partially Met**: the problem remains, but some goals have been met              | Continue nursing intervention, consider revisions                                        |
| **Goal Partially Met** or **Goal Not Met**                                             | The care plan may need to be revised, or has not yet been able to exert its full effect. |
>[!INFO] Agency SOP
>Agencies have differing standards for NCP modifications. In some, modifications may be made via **strikethrough** (~~like this~~) for the care plan, **highlighting**, or indicating revisions as appropriate for electronic charting systems. Writing "*Discontinued*", "*Goal Met*", or "*Problem Resolved*" may also be appropriate.
