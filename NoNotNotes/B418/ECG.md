description: Electrocardiography is the graphic recording of the electrical activity of the heart. This lecture covers the conduction system of the heart, lead placement, and how to read ECG waveforms and pattern.
---
Electrocardiography (ECG/EKG) is the **graphic recording of the electrical activity (electric potentials) of the heart**. It is a noninvasive and affordable method of monitoring, often readily available in health care facilities. It uses **metal electrodes** attached to the extremities and chest wall to measure electric potential, which is then visualized by the ECG machine.

# Conduction System of the Heart
1. In normal physiology, the electrical impulse originates from the **sinoatrial node**, depolarizing the **right atrium**, being recorded as a **P wave**.
2. The impulse travels down to the **atrioventricular node**,
3. The **Bundle of His** continues the impulse, splitting into the **right and left bundle branches**.
4. Finally, the **Purkinje Fibers** are predominant carriers of impulse within the ventricles, travelling downward, turning at the apex of the heart to wrap around the myocardium upwards. The resulting ventricular contraction is seen as the **QRS Complex**.
5. Finally, the **T wave** is a sign of **ventricular repolarization**.

## Depolarization-Repolarization Cycle

| Phase                                 | Electrolyte Flow                                        |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Phase 0**: **Rapid Depolarization** | Sodium rapidly enters cardiac cells                     |
|                                       | Calcium slowly enters cardiac cells                     |
| **Phase 1**: **Early Repolarization** | Sodium channels close                                   |
|                                       | Potassium temporarily increases from efflux             |
| **Phase 2**: **Plateau Phase**        | Calcium continues to flow in                            |
|                                       | Potassium continues to flow out                         |
| **Phase 3**: **Rapid Repolarization** | Potassium channels open, rapid diffusion                |
|                                       | Calcium channels become inactivated                     |
| **Phase 4**: **Resting Phase**        | Sodium-Potassium pump returns Na and K to their states. |
|                                       | Cell membranes become impermeable to sodium ions.       |

# ECG Wave Parameters
An **electrocardiograph** is an axis of time (0.04 s per cell) and electrical potential (inc). These cells are grouped into a five by five larger square, spanning 200 milliseconds.
1. **P Wave**: atrial depolarization;  the duration of **atrial conduction**. Normally **0.5 to 2.5 mm** in amplitude when graphed, and **up to 0.10s** in duration in adults.
	- **Rapid sequence of P waves** (sawtooth appearance) indicate **atrial flutter**, as the atrium rapidly depolarizes.
	- **Absence of P waves** is termed **atrial fibrillation**, when the heart fails to establish meaningful contractions, and instead wiggles in place.
2. **PR Interval**: significant duration for detecting **heart block**, as it is the period of time for impulses to travel from the SA node to the ventricles. It is measured in limb leads with the longest PR. Normally **0.12 to 0.20 s** in adults, equivalent to 70 to 90 BPM.
3. **QRS Complex**: ventricular depolarization. Normally **0.06 to 0.10 s**, at least less than **0.12 s**.
4. **QT Interval**: Normally **less than 0.44 s**.
	- A prolonged QT interval can also result from heart block.
5. **ST Segment**: the period from the end of ventricular depolarization to ventricular repolarization.
	- **ST segment elevation** is a characteristic finding for **myocardial infarction**.
	- **ST segment depression** is a sign of **myocardial ischemia**.
6. **T Wave**: ventricular repolarization

# Reading ECGs
There are multiple parameters that an ECG reading depends on. These include the **Rate**, the actual heart rate of the patient; **Pattern**, **QRS Complexes**; **P Waves**; and the **P-QRS Complex Relationship**.

>[!TIP] Heart Rate Calculation
>The formula $\text{HR}=1500/\text{\# of small squares}$ or 
$\text{HR}=300/\text{\# of big squares}$  can be used to determine the heart rate of an individual from an ECG reading.

1. **Sinus Rhythm**: the **normal** rhythm, with a **P** wave followed by **QRST** with no narrowing or widening. The normal heart rate is dictated by the **sinus** (SA) **node**, the heart's **primary pacemaker**. In an adult, the resting heart rate ranges from **60 – 100 beats/min**.

![[ecg_sinus-rhythm.png]]

2. **Sinus Bradycardia**: a **normal waveform** but with **a slow heart rate**, **less than 60 beats/min**.

![[ecg_sinus-bradycardia.png]]

3. **Sinus Tachycardia**: a **normal waveform** but with **a fast heart rate**, **more than 100 beats/min**.

![[ecg_sinus-tachycardia.png]]

4. **Sinus Arrhythmia**: a **normal waveform** occurring in **irregular intervals**; with the longest PP interval or RR interval being larger by the shortest by **0.16 seconds or more**.

![[ecg_sinus-arrhythmia.png]]

5. **Premature Atrial Complex**: a **prematurely occurring PQRST complex**. The P wave appears outside of the normal sinus beat, resulting in a long PR interval and a narrow QRS complex.

![[ecg_premature-atrial-complex.png]]

6. **Atrial Flutter**: an atrial rate of 220 to 300 beats/min, with only the P section of the waveform (atrial depolarization) appearing as flutter waves.

![[ecg_atrial-flutter.png]]

7. **Atrial Fibrillation**: the atrium is rapidly triggered, resulting in **no discernible P waves**, with an **irregular RR interval**.

![[ecg_atrial-fibrillation.png]]

8. **Junctional Rhythm**: once the primary pacemaker (SA node) fails to lead the heart's impulses, the **AV Node** takes over, but produces a lower normal heart rate. The **P wave becomes inverted or buried within or follows the QRS complex**, and the **QRS complex itself is narrow**.

![[ecg_junctional-rhythm.png]]

9. **Premature Ventricular Complex**: a **prematurely occurring complex**; the QRS complex ends up looking **wide** and **bizarre**, with **no preceding P wave**. The following **T wave becomes inverted** in defection to the QRS complex. After each PVC, a **compensatory pause** occurs for the heart to reorient its signals.

![[ecg_ventricular_premature_complex.png]]

10. **Ventricular Tachycardia**: a series of **at least three consecutive PVCs** that display **rapid**, **bizarre**, **wide QRS complexes** (>0.10s). As previously mentioned, PVCs **do not have a preceding P wave**, which normally act as the origin of ventricular impulses.

![[ecg_ventricular-tachycardia.png]]

11. **Ventricular Fibrillation**: the **complete loss of discernible P, QRS, and ST segments** as the ventricle loses its ability to contract as a unit. This is **the most common mechanism of cardiac arrest** in myocardial ischemia and infarction.

![[ecg_ventricular-fibrillation.png]]
## Heart Blocks
**Atrioventricular  blocks** are a dysfunction of the conductive system of the heart where the time between the activation of the atrium and the ventricles (PR segment) become prolonged.
1. **First Degree Atrioventricular Blocks**: a **prolonged PR interval** (>0.2s). The impulse continues as normal, hence this often appears asymptomatically and does not require treatment.
![[ecg_heart-block-first-degree.png]]

2. **Type 1 (Mobitz I or Wenckebach) Second Degree Atrioventricular Blocks**: a series of **progressively lengthening PR intervals**, until eventually **a QRS complex is dropped** (P wave not followed by QRS). This is a cyclic process that is often benign and may not require treatment.
![[ecg_heart-block-second-degree-mobitz-1.png]]

3. **Type 2 (Mobitz II) Second Degree Atrioventricular Blocks**: a stable PR interval with intermittently dropped beats (missing QRS complex).
![[ecg_heart-block-second-degree-mobitz-2.png]]

4. **Third Degree Atrioventricular Blocks**: a "**complete heart block**" where atrial and ventricular activity are completely detached from one another. The **QRS complexes often become abnormal in shape, duration, and axis**. They maintain a constant rate and morphology.
