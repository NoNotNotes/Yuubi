**Autonomic Dysreflexia** (AD) is a medical emergency that can develop suddenly which, if not treated, can lead to seizures, stroke, and even death.

>[!WARNING] Symptoms
>- Pounding headache
>- Flushing of skin and sweating above the level of injury
>- Increased blood pressure (as high as 250/150) with bradycardia
>- Apprehension, anxiety
>- Nasal congestion, vision changes, and nausea
>- Blotching of the skin; "goose bumps"
>- Tightness in the chest, flutters in the heart, trouble breathing

>[!TIP] First Aid
>1. Place the patient in a **sitting position**. **Keep the head elevated** to reduce pressure.
>2. **Drain the bladder**; if catheterized, check for kinks. A distended bladder is one of the causes of AD.
>3. **Loosen or take anything tight off**, such as restrictive garments, belts, etc. as pressure on parts of the body is also a cause of AD.
>4. **Empty the bowel** or **stop digital stimulation** until symptoms subside. The same as a distended bladder, this may cause AD.
>5. **Monitor blood pressure** every **five minutes**.
>6. Check the skin for **sores**, **toenail problems**, and the **soles of the feet**. Pressure points are a cause of AD.
>7. Seek professional help even if symptoms subside. If symptoms remain or return, **head to the emergency room**. Inform the staff of the presence of autonomic dysreflexia.
>	- Maintain the upright position, blood pressure monitoring, and identify the causes of AD.
