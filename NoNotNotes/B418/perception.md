# Traumatic Brain Injury
The leading cause of death and disability from ages 1 to 44, at an annual rate of ~52,000 deaths due to TBI, with two-thirds of that population being men. It is caused by an external mechanical force and may result in permanent or temporary impairment of cognitive, physical, and psychosocial functions, with an associated diminished or altered state of consciousness. These forces may occur from falls, collisions (vehicles, other moving objects such as a baseball), violence (gunshots, abuse, shaken baby syndrome), sports injuries, etc.

>[!EXAMPLE] Types of TBI
>1. **Closed**: the skull is not broken; the brain is not exposed. This may be due to rapid movement such as in sudden accelerations or decelerations. Depending on which region the brain hits, this may be considered as a coup (frontal) contusion from deceleration or sudden hyperextension of the head, or contrecoup (occipital) contusion from acceleration or sudden hyperflexion of the head.
>2. **Open**: a penetrating head injury which may be focal (isolated to one area) or diffuse (widespread).

The damage caused by a traumatic brain injury, i.e. it's **pathophysiology**, begins with the **primary injury**, literally the damage caused by the trauma at the moment of injury. The **secondary injury** is the damage produced after the initial trauma, such as rebound contusions (the brain bounces back onto the contrecoup after hitting the coup), swelling, increased ICP, hypoxia, etc.
1. **Primary Brain Damage**: due to two main mechanisms (a) contact, e.g. an object striking the head producing fractures or contusions, and (b) change in momentum, i.e. sudden acceleration and deceleration producing shear, tensile, and compressive strains on the brain. These may result in **intracranial hematoma** (most common cause of death in TBI), **diffuse vascular injury**, and **injury to the cranial nerves and pituitary stalk**.
>[!WARNING] Intracranial Hemorrhage
>An intracranial hemorrhage is classified according to its location:
>1. **Epidural Hematoma**: bleeding from a fracture of the temporal bone and rupture of the middle meningeal artery.
>2. **Subdural Hematoma**: bleeding from ruptured bridging veins in the subdural space.
>3. **Subarachnoid Hemorrhage**: bleeding from damage to blood vessels in the posterior fossa stalk.
>4. **Intracerebral Hemorrhage**: bleeding within the brain
>5. **Intraventricular Hemorrhage**: bleeding into the ventricles of the brain

2. **Secondary Brain Injury**: occuring hours or days after the initial injury, this may result from **impairment in cerebral blood flow** due to local edema, hemorrhage, increased intracranial pressure such, shock, disturbance of pulmonary ventilation (aspiration, chest wall instability, neurogenic disturbance), etc.
	- Decreased perfusion results in cellular destruction, causing neuronal death.
## Clinical Manifestations
1. **Cognitive Changes**: change in level of consciousness (loss of consciousness, speech, lethargy, attention deficit, mood disturbances), memory, learning, problem-solving, speed of mental processing, judgment, and decision-making.
	- Attention deficits, changes in sleep habits, and mood disturbances may be found in children with TBI, along with changes in eating habits and persistent, inconsolable crying.
2. **Physical Changes**: weakness or numbness in the extremities; persistent, potentially worsening headache, spasticity, physical paralysis, chronic pain, changes in sensorium, loss of stamina, and loss of control of the bowel and bladder.

Categorized into severity of TBI:
1. **Mild TBI**: loss of consciousness for seconds to minutes, problems with memory or concentration, headache, dizziness/loss of balance, nausea/vomiting, and difficulty sleeping
2. **Moderate to Severe TBI**: loss of consciousness for minutes to hours, problems with speech, inability to awaken from sleep, weakness or numbness in the extremities or digits, loss of coordination (ataxia), and persistent, worsening headache.

>[!BUG] Posturing
>Individuals with severely injury may experience **decorticate** or **decerebrate posturing**:
>1. **Decorticate**: the arms are **rigidly flexed** at the elbows and wrists, with the legs possible flexed with the toes rigidly pointed. This indicates a **lesion in the brain**, and may sometimes be produced by applying a painful stimulus to a comatose patient. In Glasgow's coma scale, this finding would be rated as a 3/6 on the motor scale.
>2. **Decerebrate**: the arms are **rigidly straight and internally rotated**. The legs are extended with the toes rigidly pointed. This is usually observed in patients afflicted by **compression of the brain stem at a low level**. In Glasgow's coma scale, this finding would be rated as a 2/6 on the motor scale.
>
>![[posture_decorticate-decerebrate.jpg]]
>
>The progression of a patient from a decorticate posture to a decerebrate posture indicates **worsening** of their condition, as reflected by Glasgow's coma scale.

## Complications
An altered level of consciousness is highly representative of worsening conditions in the brain for a patient with traumatic brain injury. These may appear in varying degrees:
1. **Coma**: the person is fully unconscious, resulting from widespread damage to all parts of the brain. It may take days to weeks for a person to emerge from a coma, after which they may still remain in a vegetative state.
2. **Vegetative State**: a potentially permanent state wherein individuals are physically awake, but show no signs of cognition.
3. **Minimally Conscious State**: a severely altered level of consciousness but with some evidence of self and environmental awareness.
4. **Locked-In Syndrome**: a condition where an individual's consciousness is intact, but they are unable to speak or move, often only being able to communicate with eye movement or blinking.

Other complications include :
1. **Infections**, a consistent problem in patients with skull fractures or other openings or entry points.
2. **Blood Vessel Damage** from the injury, which can result in strokes or clotting.
3. **Nerve Damage**, specifically the cranial nerves that arise directly from the brain, can result in facial paralysis, loss of vision, and dysfunction related to other cranial nerves.
## Management
**Operative management is not used to correct brain injury**. It is only used to address (a) the need for **ICP monitoring** with a bolt or other device, (b) **bleeding** within the brain; surgical removal or drainage may be necessary, and (c) **removal of skull bone fragments/damaged tissue** and **repair of skull fractures** if present in open head injuries.

**Pharmacologic management** may be used for the following:

| Indication                                    | Treatment                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Increased intracranial pressure               | **Diuresis**                                                                                            |
| Seizure activity                              | **Anti-seizure drugs**. This is used **prophylactically** during the first week of management.          |
| **Medical induction of a coma**               | Done to reduce the oxygen demands of the brain, reducing the potential for cell death in hypoperfusion. |
| **Problems with attention and concentration** | **Amantadine**, **Methylphenidate**, **Bromocriptine**, **Antidepressants**                             |

# Cerebrovascular Accident
Any **functional abnormality of the cerebral nervous system**, also called a "brain attack", cerebral infarction, cerebral hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, or simply a **stroke**. This is caused by an interruption of the blood supply to the brain, often from an aneurysm or an obstruction, resulting in damage to the brain tissue.
>[!FAQ] Etiology
>1. **Ischemic Stroke**: 85% of strokes; this is a stroke resulting from obstruction of blood vessels, often due to atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a deposition of fatty substances, cholesterol, and cellular waste products, calcium, and other substances in the inner lining of an artery. Collectively, this build-up is referred to as "plaque".
>2. **Hemorrhagic Stroke**: 15% of strokes; this is a stroke resulting from bleeding into the surrounding brain tissue (intracerebral, intraventricular, subarachnoid) from a ruptured blood vessel. These are **primarily caused by uncontrolled hypertension**. This may also be caused by an arteriovenous malformation.
>3. **Cerebral Thrombosis**: clotting in an artery that supplies a vital brain center.
>4. **Cerebral Hemorrhage**: an artery bursts as the aneurysm wall bursts potentially from a severe rise in blood pressure, causing hemorrhage and ischemia.
>5. **Cerebral Embolism**: a blood clot travels into the brain's blood vessels, shutting off blood supply.

The risk factors for cerebrovascular accidents vary, but many are related to lifestyle factors. These are divided between modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors:
1. **Non-modifiable**: age, gender, race, heredity
2. **Modifiable**: hypertension, diabetes, transient ischemic attacks (modified with aspirin use), **hyperlipidemia**, **obesity**, heart disease, oral contraceptive use (risk for emboli formation), physical inactivity, stenosis, hypercoagulability, **cigarette smoking**, and **alcohol abuse**.
## Stages of a CVA
1. **Transient Ischemic Attack** (TIA): short-lived obstructions of blood flow. These are "mini strokes" and are a warning sign for a progressive cerebrovascular disease.
	- Temporary loss of neurologic function may occur, but only last less than one day and often less than even fifteen minutes. Most of these resolve within three hours.
2. **Reversible Ischemic Neurologic Deficit** (RIND): these are TIAs that begin to produce symptoms that last up to a week.
3. **Stroke In Evolution** (SIE): gradually worsening symptoms of brain ischemia
4. **Completed Stroke** (CS): the symptoms of the stroke stabilize and rehabilitation can begin.
## Clinical Manifestations - Warning Signs
1. **Sudden weakness**, paralysis, or numbness of the **face, arm, or leg especially on one side of the body**.
2. **Sudden dimness or loss of vision** in one or both eyes, potentially including uncontrollable eye movements or eyelid drooping (ptosis).
3. **Sudden loss of speech/comprehension**, confusion, or difficulty speaking or understanding speech.
4. **Unexplained sudden dizziness**, unsteadiness, loss of balance, or coordination.
5. **Sudden, severe headache**.
6. **Swallowing difficulties or drooling** may also occur.
7. **Loss of memory** during the attack may occur.
8. **Personality changes**, **mood changes**, and changes in the level of consciousness may occur.

>[!EXAMPLE] Left-Sided Cerebrovascular Accident
>1. Right-sided hemiplegia
>2. Impaired speech and language
>3. Slow performance and impaired comprehension
>4. Visual field deficits
>5. Aware of deficits, depression, and anxiety may occur

>[!EXAMPLE] Right-Sided Cerebrovascular Accident
>1. Left-sided hemiplegia
>2. Spacial-perceptual deficits
>3. Short attention span, impaired concept of time
>4. Impaired judgment, impulsive
>5. Unaware of problems; minimizes problems

## Diagnosis
1. An **ultrasound** can show blood flow in the head via **carotid doppler studies**.
2. A **CT Scan** is the primary method of diagnosis, being able to identify the size and location of the CVA, and differentiates between ischemic and hemorrhagic type of strokes. Furthermore, a **CT Angiography** can visualize the vasculature of the brain.
3. An **MRI** is also able to visualize the brain.

>[!TIP] The FAST Method
>In a pre-hospital setting, the F.A.S.T. method may be used:
>1. **Face**: ask the person to smile. Is one side or both sides of the face droopy?
>2. **Arms**: ask the person to raise both arms. Are one of the arms drifting downward or not equal to the other?
>3. **Speech**: ask the person to repeat a simple sentence. Is their speech slurred, strange, or slow?
>4. **Time**: time is highly important in caring for a patient undergoing a stroke. Get help and emergency services as soon as possible once the presence of a stroke is suspected.
## Complications
1. **Re-bleeding**
2. **Cerebral Vasospasm**, which may produce/worsen cerebral ischemia
3. **Acute Hydrocephalus** if the ventricular system of the brain becomes dysfunctional
4. **Seizures**
5. **Motor, sensory, cranial nerve, cognitive, and other functional deficits**

## Nursing Management
1. **Assessment**: ABCs, VS, Neurologic Screening, 12-lead ECG, CBG monitoring, admittance to the stroke unit if no surgery will be done.
2. **Management**: oxygen therapy (if hypoxic), blood glucose correction if indicated, and general supportive therapy.

>[!EXAMPLE] Nursing Diagnoses
>- Ineffective tissue perfusion r/t decreased cerebrovascular blood flow
>- Ineffective airway clearance r/t level of consciousness
>- Impaired physical mobility
>- Impaired verbal communication
>- Impaired swallowing r/t loss of reflux
>- Unilateral neglect r/t visual field cut and sensory loss
>- Impaired urinary elimination
>- Situational low self-esteem r/t actual or perceived loss of function

3. **Interventions**:
	1. **Maintain skin integrity**
	2. **Encourage PROM** to affected extremities, **and AROM** to the unaffected extremities every two hours.
	3. **Elevate the affected extremities** to promote venous return and to reduce swelling
	4. Maintain a **safe environment** to reduce risk of injury
	5. Teach the **scanning technique**: turning the head side-to-side when eating and ambulating to compensate for hemanopsia.
	6. Provide care to **prevent deep vein thrombosis**: sequential compression stockings, frequent position changes, mobilization
	7. **Educate** the client on the prevention of a stroke: lifestyle changes (diet, weight control, exercise, avoid alcohol and smoking, and other risk factors), routine health assessment (check cholesterol levels (LDL <70 mg/dL), blood pressure control, blood glucose)
___
# Spinal Cord Injury
A **spinal cord injury** damages the indwelling nerves running along the spinal column. This may be caused by motor vehicle accidents, falls, violence, sporting injuries, etc. that produce hyperextension, hyperflexion, vertical compression, and extreme rotation, among other forms of injury. Acceleration, deceleration, deformation, traction, shearing, sliding, fractures, and dislocation all may cause spinal cord injury.

The extent of damage depends on what part of the spinal column is damaged, with the most damage being caused by injury to the cervical spine, then the thoracic spine, then the lumbar spine. By frequency, the proportion of each type of injury is:
1. **Incomplete Quadriplegia** (C6): 34.1%
2. **Complete Quadriplegia** (C4): 18.3%
3. **Incomplete Paraplegia** (L1): 18.1%
4. **Complete Paraplegia** (T6): 23.0%
## Clinical Manifestations
1. **Spinal Shock**: 1 week to 3 months after injury, this affects skeletal muscles, the bladder, the bowel, sexual function, and autonomic control:
	- Skeletal Muscles: Paralysis and flaccidity; loss of sensation
	- Loss of bladder and rectal control
	- Drop in blood pressure
	- Poor venous circulation
	- Poor thermal control with an impaired sympathetic nervous system
	- Sweating and capillary dilation (autonomic control)
2. **Neurogenic Shock**: a loss of sympathetic nervous system outflow will result in vasodilation, hypotension, bradycardia, and hypothermia.
3. **Autonomic Hyperreflexia** occurs when blood pressure rises after spinal shock resolves or in regions above the level of injury. The cardiovascular system responds to teh return of sympathetic nervous system stimulation, overcompensating to produce:
	- Paroxysmal hypertension: pounding headache, blurred vision
	- Sweating, flushing of skin
	- Nasal congestion, nausea
	- Piloerection
	- Bradycardia
	- Bladder or rectal distention
>[!TIP] Causes
>This is a syndrome that may occur after spinal shock resolves, but it may also be due to the nervous system "overfiring" as it attempts to reach parts of the body that are below the level of injury, i.e., not receiving the appropriate signals by the brain. This results in a clinical image of pale, cool, lower extremities (if the injury is mid-thoracic; T6), while the upper half of the body experiences severe blood pressure, flushing, headaches, distended neck veins, bradycardia, sweating, etc.
>
>The brain attempts to send these autonomic signals to parts of the body when they experience pressure (pressure areas), restrictive clothing, a full bladder (neurogenic bladder) and fecal impaction/rectal distention (neurogenic bowel).

# Seizure Disorders
___
# Guillaine-Barre Syndrome
**GBS** is a demyelinating disease also known as **Landry's paralysis**. It is an autoimmune disorder of the peripheral nervous system, which produces an acute, progressive, inflammatory demyelination of axons of the peripheral, sensory, and motor nerve roots.
