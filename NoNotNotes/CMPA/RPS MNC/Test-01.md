**Directions**: Read each question thoroughly and carefully. Then, applying Dr. RPS techniques and strategies of critical thinking, choose the best answer.

It takes a minimum of 1 hour to finish this 50-item test. It is followed by a mandatory 15- to 30-minute break. Evaluate your performance by checking your answers.
___
1. A client who has just learned she is pregnant tells the nurse that she smokes two packs of cigarettes a day. During counseling, the nurse encourages her to stop smoking because studies show that newborns of mothers who smoke are often:
	1. Born with congenital facial malformations
	2. Excessively large for gestational age
	3. Small for gestational age
	4. Postmature with meconium aspiration syndrome
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>3
>
>The most common effect of smoking is small for gestational age (SGA) babies. A woman who smokes receives nicotine, a vasoconstrictor, which diminishes feto-placental perfusion, resulting in chronic malnutrition and underoxygenation of the fetus. If the woman weans herself from smoking and finally stops on or before the fourth month, the weight of the fetus will likely be within normal limits. Chronic alcohol syndrome causes congenital facial malformations, and diabetes mellitus is a factor in abnormally large babies (LGA).

2. Of the following conditions, the one recognized as a known teratogen is:
	1. Coronary heart disease
	2. Smoking
	3. Scarlet Fever
	4. German Measles
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>4
>
>A known teratogen is a virus that can pass through the placental barrier; German measles or rubella have been identified to affect the fetus in all trimesters of pregnancy. The leading congenital defect found in babies of mothers who contracted rubella in the first trimester (<20 weeks) is a **congenital heart defect**, and the leading problem for late rubella (>20 weeks) is **premature labor**. Other complications/problems include spontaneous abortion, microcephaly, 8th cranial nerve injury resulting in deafness, congenital cataract resulting in blindness, and early or late intrauterine fetal death. Smoking causes small birth defects in gestational-age babies but is not considered a teratogen that causes congenital defects and malformations. Scarlet fever is due to bacteria (streptococci), which cannot pass through the mature placental barrier.

3. A primigravida, Mrs. Jose, tests positive for hepatitis B virus (HBV). The nurse determines that Mrs. Jose understands about this infection when she says:
	1. "I am glad I won't transfer my virus to my baby."
	2. "I understand that my baby will stay in the nursery for about a month."
	3. "So my baby will receive eye prophylaxis to prevent blindness."
	4. "I am so glad that I can breastfeed my baby after he has been vaccinated with immune serum globulin."
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>4
>
>Maternal-fetal transmission can occur through the placental barrier and may cause spontaneous infection and preterm labor. After birth, transmission can occur through breast milk and colostrum, so there is a need to protect the infant. Treatment given to the newborn is (i) hepatitis B immune globulin (or immune serum globulin), which offers immediate but temporary artificial passive protection, and (ii) the first of the three injections of hepatitis B vaccine given before discharge from the hospital; once completed, this vaccination will offer artificial, active permanent immunity (Sweet & Gibbs, 1995). After receiving the immune globulin, the newborn can be breastfed. Unlike gonorrhea and chlamydia, which cause eye infections (ophthalmia neonatorum), hepatitis B does not.

4. In the rural health unit (RHU), the nurse is interviewing primigravid Carla for health history information. What should be considered by the nurse to elicit accurate responses to questions that refer to sexually transmitted diseases? Select all that apply.
	1. Establish a therapeutic relationship between the nurse and the pregnant client.
	2. Provide privacy
	3. Use open-ended questions.
	4. Omit highly personal areas of questioning.
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>1, 2, 3
>
>A therapeutic relationship is based on trust. Once established, it can encourage the client to open up and verbalize concerns related to STDs. Communication techniques that can be used include open-ended questions, understanding and concern, a show of enthusiasm and empathy, and a caring attitude. In addition, the place for the interview should provide sufficient privacy.

5. In planning the care of a pregnant client with herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, the clinic nurse would include which of the following measures in the nursing care plan under the teaching component?
	1. Sitz bath
	2. Daily administration of acyclovir (Zovirax) to effect a cure
	3. Total abstinence from sexual intercourse
	4. Preparation for a C-section if vaginal lesions are present at the time of labor
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>4
>
>Herpes is a chronic, recurrent infection caused by HSV; it has no cure. Giving antiviral acyclovir (200 mg q4hr 5x/day while awake for 5 days to 6 months) is primarily to control and reduce duration and symptoms and decrease the severity of exacerbation; it does not effect cure. Since the most common route of transmission to the fetus is genital contact, the best mode of delivery in the presence of active lesions at the time of birth and/or when the bag of water (BOW) has ruptured is by CS. Sitz baths are not recommended.

6. In early pregnancy, a serology test for syphilis is given to pregnant women. The nurse explains to the client that the reason for this test is given because:
	1. The hormonal changes of pregnancy cause an exacerbation of latent syphilis.
	2. Syphilis may be passed to the fetus after 4 months of pregnancy.
	3. The law requires the serology test for all pregnant women.
	4. Syphilis may be passed to the infant during delivery and cause congenital syphilis.
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>2
>
>There is a placental barrier to syphilis in the first 16 weeks; after this period, the bacterium that causes syphilis— *Treponema pallidum*— can cross the placenta and cause congenital syphilis. Gonorrhea and chlamydia may be passed to the infant during delivery and cause ophthalmia neonatorum; monilial infection may also be passed to the infant during delivery and cause oral thrush.

7. Which of the following interventions, if selected by the nurse, is appropriate for a pregnant client with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) with the nursing diagnosis of high risk for infection?
	1. Offer spiritual support if desired
	2. Enforce total bed rest
	3. Provide information on safe sex practices
	4. Administer ferrous sulfate
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>3
>
>A client with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), pregnant or not, has a compromised immune system; she can easily get infections. It is vital that this client be provided with information on safe sex to prevent the spread of infection to sexual partners. Although the most common means of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission is sexual intercourse, it may also be transmitted by exposure to an infected person's body secretions, including blood, vaginal secretions, semen, breast milk/colostrum and saliva. The client with AIDS definitely needs spiritual support, but this is not infection-related; total bed rest may be implemented if there is an acute infection or condition requiring complete bed rest; and ferrous sulfate may be given to prevent anemia.

8. The nurse is interviewing Jane, an adolescent who is pregnant, during her initial RHY visit. She is beginning week 24 of her first pregnancy. Which of the following statements made by Jane indicates an immediately need for further assessment?
	1. "I don't like my figure. I could hardly fit into my clothes."
	2. "I don't like my eyes anymore. I look like I have been crying."
	3. "This dark line in the middle of my abdomen is disgusting."
	4. "I don't feel comfortable when I am flat in bed; I feel burning in the middle of my chest."
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>2
>
>Puffiness of the eyelids is a type of facial edema and is a sign of preeclampsia that needs further investigation. The clothing getting tighter, the dark line in the middle of the abdomen known as linea nigra, and the burning sensation in the chest when flat, which means heartburn or pyrosis, are all normal minor discomforts of pregnancy. To prevent minor discomfort from heartburn, avoid lying flat, bend from the knees and not from the waist when picking things off the floor, eat small, frequent meals, and avoid fatty and spicy foods. Also give instructions on proper clothing selection and psychological support related to skin changes.

9. As part of the prenatal teaching, the nurse instructs the client to immediately report any blurring or dimness of vision. The best rationale for this instruction is that the symptom is:
	1. Indicative of renal failure
	2. A forerunner to preeclampsia
	3. A sign of avitaminosis A
	4. Indicative of liver failure
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>2
>
>Visual disturbances (dimness, blurring, and double vision) are considered forerunners of preeclampsia, together with sudden weight gain. Furthermore, severe and persistent headaches, dizziness, and excessive vomiting are signs of cerebral edema that need immediate reporting. Preeclampsia is characterized by the triad signs of hypertension, proteinuria, and edema. The presence of convulsions and coma converts preeclampsia to the more serious eclampsia.

10. Primigravid 16-year-old Susie comes to the prenatal clinic for her monthly check-up. She has gained 20 lbs. from her 30–36 weeks; her face and hands indicate edema. She is diagnosed as having severe PIH and referred to the high-risk prenatal clinic. The client's weight increase is most likely due to:
	1. Hypertension
	2. Overeating
	3. Fluid retention
	4. Obesity
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>3
>
>Sudden excessive weight gain (greater than 1–2 lb./week) is a forerunner of preeclampsia. The excess weight gain of a woman who has pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) is due to fluid retention. Albuminuria in PIH allows the excess loss of serum albumin, which reduces colloidal osmotic pressure. This then allows the movement of fluids from the intravascular (plasma) to interstitial spaces, causing edema, but such transfer also results in reduced circulating volume and a rise in hematocrit. With decreased circulating volume, renal perfusion is compromised; the kidneys respond by reabsorbing sodium and water, causing oliguria and exacerbating generalized edema. **Oliguria is a grave sign, and diuresis is a good sign** in preeclampsia-eclampsia.

11. Primigravid Belen, 30 weeks pregnant, is admitted for management of severe preeclampsia. Belen's treatment includes intravenous magnesium sulfate. Which of the following assessment findings would alert the nurse to suspect hypermagnesemia?
	1. Decreased deep tendon reflexes
	2. Cool skin temperature
	3. Rapid pulse rate
	4. Tingling in the toes
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>1
>
>Magnesium sulfate is a CNS depressant given to preeclamptic clients primarily to prevent seizures or convulsions by depressing the CNS. Before a convulsion, the client is hyperreflexive with a DTR/knee jerk reflex of +4. Magnesium sulfate depresses DTR to +2 (normal level) and even up to +1 (maximum acceptable level). Once the DTR is absent, it has reached its toxic level because the first reflex to be lost in CNS depression is the DTR. Ergo, before giving another dose of magnesium sulfate, the most important thing to check is the DTR; if negative, withhold the drug and notify the physician. Also anticipate administering, as ordered, **calcium gluconate** as an antidote. Magnesium sulfate also depresses maternal and fetal respiration. Check also the RR before giving magnesium sulfate; measure sure it is at least 14/minute. There is only one way of excreting magnesium, and that is through urine; an output of at least 30 mL/hour ensures adequate excretion of the drug and prevents hypermagnesemia. Do not give magnesium sulfate if the hourly urine output is less than 30 mL. The newborn of a preeclamptic-eclamptic mother who received magnesium sulfate may also manifest respiratory depression. A respiratory rate of less than 30/minute (Normally 30–60) means depression, and the use of a respiratory stimulant (narcotic antagonist) is anticipated in the form of Naloxone Hydrochloride (Narcan).

12. Whenever magnesium sulfate is used to prevent convulsions in the preeclamptic clients, its antidote should always be available. This antidote is:
	1. Acetylcysteine
	2. Calcium gluconate
	3. Propranolol
	4. Ipecac Syrup
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>2
>
>Calcium gluconate is magnesium sulfate's antidote; Mucomyst is for acetaminophen; Inderal is for ritodrine hydrochloride; and Ipecac syrup is for aspirin.

13. Primigravid Dina, 32 weeks pregnant, is admitted to the maternity unit with severe preeclampsia. While her vital signs are being checked by the nurse, she goes into convulsions. Which nursing action would be contraindicated in caring for Dina during an episode of convulsive eclampsia?
	1. Not leaving the client
	2. Firmly restraining the client to prevent self-injury
	3. Keeping air passages clear of secretions
	4. Having the siderails up and padded
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>2
>
>In the care of a convulsing client, ensure patency of the airway and protection from injury. Do not leave a convulsing patient alone; stay, position the client for drainage (lateral), suction the mouth and nose (using a bulb syringe), and pad the side rails using pillows (to protect soft tissues and prevent falls). Do not apply a tongue depressor or leather restraints, which may cause more harm.

14. When a woman who is confirmed to be at 12 weeks gestation has sudden vaginal bleeding and uterine cramps, she would be suspected to be experiencing:
	1. Hydatidiform mole
	2. Abortion
	3. Placenta previa
	4. Abruptio placenta
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>2
>
>In early pregnancy (first 20 weeks), the leading causes of vaginal bleeding are abortion, ectopic pregnancy, and hydatidiform moles, whereas in the late/third trimesters, including labor, the leading causes of bleeding are placenta previa and abruptio placenta. Abortion is the most common cause of early pregnancy bleeding. Signs of abortion include vaginal bleeding (which may range from spotting to profuse, depending on the type), abdominal cramps/uterine cramps (from mild to severe), may or may not have the passage of the products of conception (depending on the type). Significant signs of a hydatidiform mole include brownish vaginal bleeding (profuse or intermittent), a bigger than date uterus, a markedly elevated hCG level, signs of pregnancy-induced hypertension before 23 weeks gestation, and the absence of fetal signs.

15. The factors that play a significant role in the causation of spontaneous abortion include:
	1. Smoking, paternal factors, young age
	2. Accidents, early pregnancy coitus, high parity
	3. Infection, defective ovum, diabetes mellitus, incompetent cervix
	4. Competent cervix, high parity, and heart defects
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>3
>
>Abortion can be spontaneous or induced (therapeutically or criminally). For spontaneous abortion, the causes include congenital defects/**defective ovum** (the leading cause), **maternal causes** (viral infection like rubella, incompetent cervix = leading cause of habitual abortion and endocrine diseases like DM), and **unknown** causes. Types of spontaneous abortion are threatened (cervix close), inevitable (cervix open), incomplete (placenta and membranes retained), complete (all products of conception passed out), imminent (with gross rupture of bag of water (BOW)), habitual (three or more consecutive abortions), and missed (fetus dies but is retained).

16. Mrs. Max, at 10 weeks gestation, complains to the physician of slight vaginal bleeding and mild cramps. On examination, her physician determines that her cervix is closed. The client is exhibiting signs of:
	1. An inevitable abortion
	2. An incomplete abortion
	3. A threatened abortion
	4. A missed abortion
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>3
>
>The single most important sign of a threatened abortion is a close cervix. Other signs include spotting and uterine cramps, which may be absent or just mild. Once the cervix opens, it becomes inevitable abortion. When the bag of waters ruptures, it becomes an imminent abortion or an abortion in progress. When the fetus is out but the placenta and embryonic sac remain, we term it incomplete abortion (bleeds the most), but when all products of conception are passed, it is complete abortion (cervix close, no more cramps, and usually no more bleeding). The presence of three or more consecutive abortions makes it a habitual abortion. And when the fetus dies but is retained, it is a missed abortion. The retained products of conception can become so soft (maceration) or so hard like a stone (lithopedion formation). The prolonged retention of the dead products of conception can place the woman at risk for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

17. A competent maternity care provider should be able to identify early signs of abortion in order to be able to save a product of conception. Which of the following represents an incomplete abortion? Select all that apply.
	1. Profuse vaginal bleeding
	2. Passage of the fetus, placenta, and embryonic sac
	3. Mild abdominal pain
	4. Severe uterine cramps
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>1, 4
>
>Incomplete abortion is characterized by the passage of the fetus with some of the products of conception (placenta, embryonic sac) retained in the uterus. This type of abortion bleeds the most, and for as long as some products are retained, uterine cramping is strong as the uterus attempts to contract in order to expel the remaining products. Treatment includes oxytocic drugs, dilatation and curettage (D&C), fluids, blood (if indicated), and antibiotics. The woman may also be given RhoGAM if she is Rh-negative, her abortus is Rh-positive, and Coombs test is negative.

18. At 16 weeks of gestation, a pregnant client is admitted to the maternity unit to have a McDonald procedure (cerclage) done. When asked about the purpose of this procedure, the nurse answers correctly by explaining that this procedure is to:
	1. Reinforce an incompetent cervix permanently
	2. Evaluate the cephalopelvic disproportion
	3. Dilate the cervix
	4. Reinforce an incompetent cervix temporarily
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>4
>
>The McDonald cerclage procedure is temporary suturing of the cervix; the most common cerclage procedure. At the time of labor, the nurse may anticipate preparing the stitch removal set in addition to the vaginal delivery set. The Shirodkar-barter procedure is permanent suturing of an incompetent cervix (the most common cause of habitual abortion); the client will delivery by cesarean section at term and in all future pregnancies. Dilating the cervix is performed in D&C, and evaluating CPD is done by X-ray pelvimetry.

19. Jane, an unmarried by sexually active 24-year-old woman, tells the nurse that she missed one menstrual cycle and that her next cycle resulted in a slight amount of blood flow. Considering the history of her menstrual cycle, the nurse suspects she may have a tubal pregnancy. What is the most appropriate initial intervention?
	1. Make her the priority patient to be seen by the physician.
	2. Ask her if she has a history of tubal pregnancy.
	3. Position her on the examination table and palpate her abdomen for the presence of a unilateral pelvic pain over a mass.
	4. Take her vital signs to determine any abnormal findings.
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>3
>
>The triad signs associated with early ruptured extrauterine pregnancy are the menstrual cycle history (one or two missed menses), unilateral pelvic pain, and the presence of a cul-de-sac mass. The first sign of ruptured tubal pregnancy is unilateral pelvic pain radiating to the shoulder (Kehr's sign); later, a bluish navel (Cullen's sign) may be observed. Although a history of an ectopic pregnancy places one at risk for a repeated occurrence, this is not the most appropriate initial intervention. Salpingectomy, or removal of the fallopian tube, is the usual treatment for ruptured ectopic pregnancies.

20. Which of the following is the most common factor related to the development of tubal pregnancy?
	1. Primigravidity
	2. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)
	3. Multiple pregnancy
	4. Uterine tumor
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>2
>
>Damage to the fallopian tubes from pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is identified as the most common cause of ectopic pregnancy. The leading causes implicated in the development of PIDs are *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* and *Chlamydia trachomitis* infections (Kamwendo et al., 2000). Symptoms of PID include fever, chills, malaise, bilateral sharp, cramping pain in the lower quadrants, irregular bleeding, nausea, and vomiting. Other factors contributing to ectopic pregnancy include a history of ectopic pregnancy, a congenital defects of the tube, tubal surgery, and the use of an intrauterine device (IUD). The most common type of ectopic pregnancy is tubal (95% of all cases); thus, ectopic pregnancy is also referred to as tubal pregnancy.

21. Mrs. Hilario, amenorrheic for two months, is diagnosed with a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. Which of the following are signs and symptoms of ectopic pregnancy? Select all that apply.
	1. Cullen's sign
	2. Kehr's sign
	3. Sudden bradycardia
	4. Profuse external bleeding
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>1, 2
>
>When the pregnant fallopian tube ruptures, there will be a characteristic sudden, severe low quadrant pain to the shoulder, termed Kehr's sign. Internal bleeding is more likely to cause a bluish navel (Cullen's sign), and external vaginal bleeding is only slight due to the site of the ampulla that ruptures (the outer third of the tube). The loss of circulating blood volume will cause a lowering of blood pressure (hypotension) and a rise in PR (tachycardia) and RR (tachypnea).

22. In the care of a client with a ruptured ectopic pregnancy, which of the following activities should be implemented?
	1. Monitoring vital signs
	2. Performing an abdominal scrub in preparation for CS
	3. Repositioning to the left
	4. All of the above
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>1
>
>The nursing management of ectopic pregnancy is to monitor vital signs and to help determine the degree of internal bleeding, as the amount of external bleeding is not proportional to the amount of peritoneal cavity bleeding. The surgical management for ectopic pregnancy is the removal of the affected tube (salpingectomy), not CS. And because ectopic pregnancy usually occurs in early pregnancy when the uterus is still a pelvic organ, the left lateral position causing vena caval syndrome is not relevant here.

23. The physician ordered preparation of a client with suspected ruptured tubal pregnancy for culdocentesis. Which of these preparations are appropriate? Select all that apply.
	1. Check if there is informed consent.
	2. Assess feelings and concerns about the procedure.
	3. Position the client on a dorsal recumbent.
	4. Prepare sterile gloves, a vaginal speculum, lubricant, and a flood lamp.
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>1, 2, 4
>
>All are preparations for culdocentesis, except the positioning. In order to reach the cul-de-sac of Douglas at the posterior vaginal fornix, the lithotomy position is most appropriate. The aspiration of nonclotting blood from the cul-de-sac of Douglas confirms a ruptured ectopic pregnancy.


24. Rho (D) immune globulin (RhoGAM) is ordered for a client before she is discharged after an ectopic pregnancy. The nurse understands that the rationale for RhoGAM administration is to prevent which of the following?
	1. Development of a future Rh-positive fetus
	2. An antibody response to Rh-negative blood
	3. A future pregnancy resulting in abortion
	4. Development of Rh-positive antibodies
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>4
>
>Rh isoimmunization can result if the mother is Rh-negative and carries an ectopic pregnancy that is Rh-positive. After uterine evacuation and placental delivery, Rh-positive antigens can reach maternal circulation and trigger the formation in the mother of antibodies (isoimmunization) that are anti-Rh-positive red blood cells. To prevent isoimmunization and hemolytic disease in future infants, **RhoGAM is administered in the first 72 hours to the Rh-negative mother who delivered an Rh-positive baby**. With a negative Coombs test, RhoGAM may be given after an abortion, ectopic pregnancy, or normal pregnancy. It offers temporary, artificial passive immunity and may be repeated in the future if the same situational criteria are present.

25. A client, amenorrheic for 3 months, comes to the hospital with complaints of vaginal discharge and is diagnosed to have hydatidiform mole. Which of the following signs is not consistent with the diagnosis?
	1. Bright red vaginal bleeding
	2. Fundal height palpated at the level of the navel
	3. BP of 140/90
	4. Cullen's sign
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>4
>
>H-mole is a benign neoplasm of the chorion. The triad signs are vaginal bleeding (from red, profuse to dark brownish and intermittent), uterine fundus bigger than date (usually at umbilical level when only three menses are missed), and excessive human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG; 1–2 million IU/L/24 hrs.) when normal levels at their peak at 8 to 10 weeks average are only 400,000 IU/L/24 hrs. Other signs include a positive pregnancy test, signs of pregnancy-induced hypertension before 20 weeks gestation, and the absence of fatal signs such as FHR, fetal outline, fetal movement, and fetal skeleton. This is confirmed by ultrasonography. Cullen's sign is a bluish navel due to internal bleeding found in ruptured ectopic pregnancies.

26. When asked about the cause of H-mole, your answer will reflect an understanding that the exact cause of H-mole is:
	1. Low-protein diet
	2. History of abortion
	3. Unknown
	4. Low socioeconomic status
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>3
>
>H-mole is found often in Oriental women, women over 40 years old, with low socioeconomic status, and whose diet is low in protein, but the exact cause is essentially unknown (Kain & Hall, 2000). The most serious complication of H-mole during its acute phase is hemorrhage, whereas the dreaded future complication is cancer—choriocarcinoma.

27. Forty-year-old Mrs. David receives a diagnosis of H-mole, which was treated by thorough evacuation with dilatation and curettage. Which of the following discharge health instructions is inappropriate?
	1. Avoid pregnancy for 6 months.
	2. Report for regular follow-up checkups.
	3. Take highly nutritious foods, particularly those rich in iron.
	4. Do not fail to take her contraceptive method.
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>1
>
>Hydatidiform mole (molar pregnancy) is a benign neoplasm of the chorion, a trophoblastic disease that may result in a complication known as choriocarcinoma. For this reason, even after discharge, there is a need for follow-up checkup and monitoring of hCG titers for one year. This necessitates the prevention of pregnancy for one year with the proper use of prescribed contraceptive means. Because of the blood loos that accompanies H-mole, which predisposes to anemia and infection, the woman needs to eat highly nutritious foods rich in vitamin C and iron.

28. A client who is ordered for diagnostic pelvic ultrasound asks what preparations she will take. Appropriate preparations for this procedure include:
	1. Explanation of the procedure
	2. Informed consent
	3. Void
	4. NPO 6 hours prior
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>1
>
>Ultrasonography is a non-invasive diagnostic procedure commonly used in obstetrics. It uses high-frequency sound waves to detect intrabody structures. Ultrasound does not require informed consent as it is safe, non-invasive, and does not use ionizing radiation. Preparations include explaining to the client the procedure to allay anxiety related to it, instructing the client to drink 1 quart of water 2 hours before, and instructing the client **not** to void until after the procedure.

29. Pelvic ultrasound can detect which of the following?
	1. Fetal sex, number, and lung maturity
	2. Congenital defects in structure, fetal gender, H-mole
	3. Fetal DM, multiple pregnancies, fetal age of gestation
	4. Fetal congenital defects, placental previa, fetal lung maturity
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>2
>
>Ultrasound can detect intrabody structures. In early pregnancy, it is used to identify the gestational sac, and in later pregnancy, it is used to identify fetal viability, growth patterns, fetal number (multiple pregnancies),  gender (from 12 weeks onwards), anomalies, fluid volume, and uterine anomalies. It can also be used to identify gestational age by measuring the biparietal diameter (a biparietal diameter of 9.5 cm equals 36 weeks of gestation). Fetal lung maturity is detected using amniocentesis, foam stability tests, and shake tests but not ultrasound.

30. The nurse is conducting a clinic visit with a prenatal client with heart disease. The nurse carefully evaluates vital signs, weight gain, and fluid and nutritional status to detect complications caused by:
	1. Hypertrophy and increased contractility
	2. The increase in circulating volume
	3. Fetal cardiomegaly
	4. Rh incompatibility
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>2
>
>The leading conditions that can result in a cardiac disease complicating pregnancy are rheumatic heart disease and congenital heart defects. In pregnancy, the added load on the heart brought about by increasing circulating volume, cardiac output, and cardiac rate may cause left-sided congestive heart failure (CHN). A moist cough productive of frothy, pinking sputum, increased dyspnea with minimal activity, and orthopnea, plus a pulse rate over 120/min. and respiratory rate over 24/min indicate pulmonary edema, a characteristic postpartum period because the 30–50% increase in plasma volume is **suddenly** reabsorbed into the general circulation, causing **circulatory overloading**.

31. Mrs. Diaz, a G₂P₁ with class II cardiac disease, is now in the thirty-fourth week of gestation. She is scheduled for a nonstress test (NST). The nurse, after explaining the procedure, evaluates that Mrs. Diaz understands the teaching when she says:
	1. "I hope my baby doesn't get distressed after this procedure."
	2. "If my baby's heart reacts normally during the test, he should do okay during delivery."
	3. "I hate receiving injections, but now I understand why it's necessary."
	4. "I understand now why I need to be confined for 1 to 2 days."
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization

>The nonstress test (NST) is used to test fetal well-being by evaluating its response to movements. It is based on the principle that if the fetus moves, FHR accelerates. The test result is **reactive**, if there are two or more accelerations of 15 BPM lasting 15 seconds or more in a 20-minute period. This implies fetal health and well-being. A test result is **nonreactive** if there are **no FHR accelerations** with fetal movement or accelerations that are less than 15 BPM or last less than 15 seconds. It takes 30–60 minutes to accomplish and may be done in an out-patient unit. This test will not require IV fluids or injections and will not cause fetal distress.

32. After a nonstress test is completed, the nurse looks at the test results on the monitor strip. The RN observes that the fetal heart accelerates to 15 BPM with each fetal movement. The accelerations lasted 20 seconds and occurred three times during the 20-minute test. The nurse is correct in interpreting the test as:
	1. Reactive test
	2. Nonreactive test
	3. Positive test
	4. Negative Test
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>1
>
>A fetal heart rate acceleration of 15 BPM lasting for 20 seconds and occurring three times in a 20-minute period is within the criteria of a normal **reactive** response in NST. Positive and negative tests are the interpretations of results in the oxytocin challenge test (OCT), also known as the contraction stress test (CST). A positive test in OCT means there are late decelerations in FHR in three contractions in 10 minutes (implies fetal distress); a negative test means there are no late decelerations (implies fetal well-being).

33. Mrs. Cortez, a primigravid client at 20 weeks gestation and with a history of heart disease, has been instructed on home management. Which of the following statements, if made by Mrs. Cortez, indicates that she needs further teaching?
	1. "I need to observe some restrictions on people who visit me."
	2. "I should avoid stressful situations."
	3. "My weight gain is not important."
	4. "I should report early signs of infection."

>The most important principle in the management of clients with cardiac disease is **rest**: physical, mental, and emotional rest. To have adequate rest and sleep, the client should observe some restrictions on people who visit her: keep visits short and avoid visits from friends or relatives with infections. Early signs of infection should be reported immediately for diagnosis and prompt treatment; infection and fever strain the heart. A proper diet ensures normal weight gain, but excess weight gain is avoided.

34. You are planning a home visit evaluate the condition of Beth, who is 12 weeks pregnant and has a history of cardiac disease that was being treated with digitalis therapy before this pregnancy. Which of the following would you anticipate happening with Beth's drug therapy regimen?
	1. Need for a change in medication
	2. Continuation of the same dosage
	3. Switching to a more potent brand
	4. Addition of a diuretic and an antibiotic to the regimen
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization

>
>Since there is no adequate data supporting the need to change the medication, either in brand or in strength,  it is proper to simply assume that Beth will continue with the digitalis therapy. An aggravation of the client's condition with the development of congestive heart failure compounded by infection necessitates a change in digitalis dose, the use of diuretics, and the initiation of antibiotics. Common side effects of digitalis include nausea, vomiting, and bradycardia; check the cardiac rate before digitalis administration and withhold if below 60 bpm.

35. Multigravid Divine is in the first stage of labor, the active phase. Considering that Divine has a complicating heart disease due to rheumatic fever, which of the following interventions will you include in the care plan?
	1. Encourage ambulation to improve labor contractions.
	2. Anticipate and prepare for operative obstetrics.
	3. Reinforce instructions on correct, strong pushing.
	4. Give continuous oxygen through the nasal cannula.

>Depending on the functional capacity of her heart, a parturient with a heart disease needs to have adequate rest. She has to be in bed in semi-Fowler's position; oxygen may or may not be given, and if ever oxygen is given, it will likely be per mask (and not per cannula) because women in labor tend to breathe through the mouth. Pushing efforts strain the heart; if ever her heart condition allows pushing, she should do it moderately **but not** in the active phase of labor. These parturients are often given analgesia/anesthesia in order to eliminate pain and prevent spontaneous pushing, which contributes stress to the heart. To shorten the second stage of labor, the attending physician will likely perform an episiotomy and forceps delivery, part of operative obstetrics.

36. Mrs. Andres, a G₄P₃, is admitted to the prenatal clinic at eight and one-half months of gestation with a diagnosis of placenta previa, incomplete. The chief complaint is painless vaginal bleeding. Which action should the nurse perform initially?
	1. Anticipate and set up for emergency LCCS
	2. Elevate the foot of the bed, check for cervical dilatation, and check vital signs.
	3. Assess the amount and character of the bleeding.
	4. Check the FHT, anticipate, and set up for oxygen therapy.

>Placenta previa is the premature separation of a lowly implanted placenta. The characteristic symptoms are painless and usually intermitted vaginal bleeding, which is fresh and bright red in color, and a soft and flaccid uterus, except when the woman is in labor, where the uterus contracts and relaxes intermittently. Bleeding is usually not severe unless an IE is done, which can cause increased bleeding. IE is **never** a nursing action in suspected placenta previa. The first thing to do in this situation is to assess the amount and character of the bleeding. There is no sufficient data to support a shock position; there is no sufficient data indicating fetal distress to require maternal oxygenation. The key word "initially" implies "assessment," so any nursing implementation or action makes a choice incorrect. If placenta previa is managed by CS, it should be classical CS and not low cervical CS (LCCS) because the placenta is low-lying.

37. A client asks you how she developed placenta previa when she has been submitting herself to regular prenatal checkups. You will base your response on an understanding of the etiology of placenta previa, which includes:
	1. Advancing age, nulliparity, and previous low cervical CS
	2. Young age, tumor in the lower uterine segment, and previous low cervical CS
	3. Multiparity, multifetal pregnancy, and scarring or tumor in the upper third of the uterus
	4. Low age and parity; previous CS scar
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization

>Although its exact cause is unknown, the single most important factor in placenta previa is multiparity. Other factors include scarring (from previous classical CS) or tumors in the upper uterine segment preventing normal implantation, multiple or multifetal pregnancies, and increased age.

38. The assessment findings in placenta previa include? Select all that apply.
	1. Hard board-like abdomen
	2. Flaccid uterus
	3. Painless vaginal bleeding
	4. Signs of anaphylactic shock
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization

>Placenta previa is characterized by **painless**, fresh, external, bright-red vaginal bleeding, a flaccid uterus (except in labor when the uterus contracts intermittently), and possible signs of hypovolemic (and not anaphylactic) shock if bleeding is profuse. An internal vaginal examination of the placenta previa can cause severe bleeding, which is why it should never be performed by a nurse or midwife. A trained physician may elect to do an IE in the presence of some conditions: the presence of a double set-up in the operating room; the fetus is term and stable; and the woman is in labor. If bleeding is severe and the fetus is in distress, the procedure of choice is emergency classical CS to promptly deliver the baby and placenta and contract the uterus. After delivery, monitor the woman for bleeding because the lower uterine segment (the site of placental detachment in placenta previa) is not as contractile as the upper fundal segment (the normal site of implantation).

39. In taking care of patients with placenta previa, the health personnel should do the following except:
	1. Internal vaginal examination
	2. Inform relatives to prepare blood for a possible transfusion
	3. Notify pediatrician/nursery nurse of the possible admission of a preterm baby
	4. Prepare a double-set-up delivery when labor is imminent
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>1
>
>Any internal examination may cause increased vaginal bleeding, so never perform an IE on a suspected placenta previa. If the pregnancy is term, the woman is in labor and stable, and the fetus is stable with normal FHRs, the physician may perform an IE under a double set-up (one for normal vaginal delivery and another for classical CS). But if the woman is hemorrhaging, the fetus is distressed, and/or the woman is not in labor, an emergency classical CS (not a low cervical CS because the placenta is low-lying) is performed. Prematurity is the most common complication of placenta previa and the leading cause of perinatal loss.

40. The nurse assessing Mrs. Jose, 33 weeks pregnant, with vaginal bleeding is aware that an abruptio placenta is accompanied by which of the following assessment findings?
	1. Abdomen soft upon palpation
	2. No complaint of abdominal pain
	3. Lack of uterine irritability
	4. Uterine tenderness upon palpation
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization

>Abruptio placenta is the premature separation of a normally implanted placenta. The uterus in abruptio is characteristically hard, boardlike, tender, and painful. In labor, the characteristic hard-soft pattern that is typical of normal contractions is not appreciated; instead, tetanic contractions are observed. The classic abruptio placenta is of the central, concealed, or covert type, where bleeding accumulates behind the placenta and the signs of hypovolemic shock are not proportional to the amount of external bleeding. If abruptio is the external or over type where the placental margins separate first, the vaginal bleeding is old and dark red. In placenta previa, the uterus is soft, and external bleeding is painless.

41. Which of the following findings best indicates abruptio placenta and not placenta previa
	1. The amount of external bleeding
	2. The presence of a flaccid uterus
	3. The absence of pain
	4. Strong, tetanic contractions
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>In the classic abruptio placenta, bleeding is concealed behind the placenta so that the signs of shock are not proportional to the degree of external vaginal bleeding. The accumulating blood behind the placenta causes increased retroperitoneal pressure, leading to a painful, hard, and boardlike abdomen. During early labor, abruptio placenta manifests as tetanic contractions (strong and painful contractions that last for two minutes or longer). An early sign of abruptio placenta is increased uterine irritability. Placenta previa is characterized by painless vaginal bleeding (fresh, overt, and bright red and a flaccid uterus. In labor, the woman with placenta previa shows the characteristic normal pattern of contract-relax/soft-hard in response to the uterine contractions.

42. The nurse realizes that the abdominal pain associated with abruptio placenta may be initially caused by:
	1. Hemorrhagic shock
	2. Inflammatory reactions
	3. Concealed hemorrhage
	4. Blood in the uterine muscle
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>3
>
>The classic type of abruptio placenta is the concealed or covert type. In this type, the placenta starts to separate from the center, causing blood to accumulate behind the placenta. This gradual buildup of blood (later retroplacental blood clot) causes increased pressure behind the placenta, thus the resultant hard, boardlike, and painful abdomen typical of abruptio placenta. As the condition progresses, liquid blood may penetrate the deeper layers of the uterus and cause the phenomenon of Couvelaire uterus.

43. The complications of abruptio placenta do not include:
	1. Hemorrhage
	2. Disseminated intravascular coagulation
	3. Couvelaire uterus
	4. Postmaturity
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization

>Complications of abruptio placenta include hemorrhage, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which can lead to cerebrovascular accident (CVA), Couvelaire uterus, and **prematurity**. The life-threatening complications is hemorrhage and usually requires aggressive resuscitation with IV fluids, blood pressure support, oxygen therapy, and evacuation of the uterus (Clark et al., 1997). Significant factors contributing to abruptio placenta include arteriolar vasoconstriction and spasm in eclampsia, trauma, a short umbilical cord, and strong uterine contractions as a result of improper use of oxytocin during induction or augmentation of labor. After a convulsion in eclampsia, it is imperative to check the abdomen for early signs of abruptio placenta— uterine irritability.

44. A diabetic pregnant client is unsure of the date of her last menstrual period (LMP); she says that she missed three menses, but her fundus palpated slightly below the level of the umbilicus. Means other than Naegele's rule will be used to determine the estimated date of delivery. The nurse would expect that physician to estimate the date by:
	1. Hearing the first audible fetal heart tone with a fetoscope
	2. Serial estriols
	3. Ultrasonography
	4. The nonstress test
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization

>
>Ultrasonography is the most accurate test of those listed for determining pregnancy can now be used as early as 5 weeks. Hearing the FHR with a fetoscope is the safest way to determine EDD (previously EDC). However, the FHR cannot be heard by auscultation until 20 weeks of gestation. Serial estriols and the nonstress test are done later in pregnancy as methods of determining fetal status or well-being, not EDD.

45. A pregnant client, 28 weeks pregnant, has Type I diabetes mellitus. On assessment, which sign are you likely to identify?
	1. Fundus midway between the symphysis pubis and the navel
	2. FHR on auscultation
	3. Low serial estriol levels
	4. Anorexia and oliguria
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>2
>
>At 28 weeks, the FHR can already be auscultated (as early as 20 weeks). The fetus of a diabetic mother is more likely to be bigger than smaller, and at 28 weeks, it should not be palpated below the umbilicus unless there is a failure to grow for whatever reasons. At 28 weeks, the fundus is more likely to be palpated midway between the navel and the xiphoid process, or slightly higher, because fetuses of diabetics tend to be bigger than normal due to the insulin-antagonistic hormones of pregnancy. The classic triad signs of diabetes mellitus are excessive appetite (polyphagia), excessive urination (polyuria), and excessive third (polydipsia); anorexia and oliguria are not likely to manifest. And if diabetes is controlled, fetal well-being can be assured. Increased (and not low) levels of serial estriol signify fetal health; values of 12–50 mg/day mean fetal well-being. For an order of serial estriol determination, urine is often the specimen; expect to prepare 24-hour urine (although maternal serum may also be used).

46. The nurse understands that a diabetic mother's metabolism is significant altered during pregnancy as a result of:
	1. Renal insufficiency in pregnancy
	2. Increased effect of insulin during pregnancy
	3. Decrease in serum glucose during pregnancy
	4. Effect of pregnancy hormones on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>4
>
>In pregnancy, the placenta hormones estrogen, progesterone, and human placental lactogen (hPL), also called human chorionic somatomammotropin (hCS), plus the adrenal cortex hormone cortisol, all antagonize maternal **insulin**, rendering it **ineffective**. The major insulin antagonist or glucose-sparing hormone in pregnancy is hPL. As a consequence of these insulin-antagonist or glucose-sparing hormones, the effectiveness of insulin is decreased, causing blood glucose levels in pregnant women to be higher, and glucose on urine testing becomes a usual, normal finding. Ineffective insulin in pregnancy affects carbohydrate and fat metabolism.

47. The nurse prepares a teaching plan for a newly diagnosed diabetic pregnant client. Which of the following should not be included in the teaching plan?
	1. Effects of diabetes on pregnancy and the fetus
	2. Nutritional requirements for pregnancy and diabetic control
	3. To avoid exercise due to its negative effects on insulin production
	4. To be aware of any infections and report signs of infection immediately to the health care provider
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>3
>
>All are included in the teaching plan except the avoidance of exercise. Diabetic clients, pregnant or not, are encouraged to exercise regularly. Exercise increases the utilization of glucose by cells, causing a reduction in blood glucose and thereby reducing insulin requirements. Remember this equation: ↑ exercise = ↓ insulin. Avoid excessive exercise as this may cause hypoglycemia.

48. Hyperglycemia results from poor diabetes control during pregnancy and can result in perinatal morbidity and mortality. When evaluating the pregnant client, the nurse knows that the recommended serum glucose range during pregnancy is:
	1. 70 mg/dL to 120 mg/dL
	2. 50 mg/dL to 140 mg/dL
	3. 140 mg/dL to 200 mg/dL
	4. 60 mg/dL to 80 mg/dL
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>1
>
>In order to prevent perinatal morbidity and mortality, a diabetic client should have her serum glucose maintained within the normal range of 70 mg/dL to 120 mg/dL. This requires compliance with respect to the triad management principles of insulin, diet, and exercise. Because of the hormones of pregnancy that antagonize insulin (major antagonist: hPL), the pregnant diabetic needs an increased dose of insulin in pregnancy (usually no increase in the first trimester as insulin-antagonistic hormones are still low), IV regular insulin in labor, and a drop in insulin requirement in the immediate postpartum when her insulin becomes more effective owing to the drop in serum levels of placental hormones. The diet should be well-balanced and taken regularly as small, frequent meals. As to exercise, an increased amount of exercise requires a dose of insulin.

49. The physician orders a maternal blood test for alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) for your diabetic client at 16 weeks of gestation. When asked about the rationale of the test, your explanation will be based on the understanding that this test is used to detect which of the following?
	1. Neural tube defects
	2. Chromosomal defects
	3. Fetal diabetes mellitus
	4. Lecithin-sphingomyelin ratio
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization

>If the mother is diabetic, the baby is at high risk for various conditions such as congenital defects, macrosomia (LGA), prematurity, and hypoglycemia. A test for alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), a major plasma protein of the fetus, is performed to determine neural tube defects such as spina bifida, anencephaly, and even esophageal atresia. AFP increases in the first trimester, then decreases after 13 weeks gestation; persistently increased levels after this period may mean the presence of a neural defect. AFP testing requires amniocentesis (commonly done between the 14th and 16th weeks of gestation) and a biochemical analysis of amniotic fluid. The amniotic fluid, which contains cells sloughed off by the developing embryo, is cultured to obtain a large number of cells and then analyzed biochemically. Indications for amniocentesis include an increased risk of neural tube defects, advanced maternal age, a previous history of chromosomal aberrations, and a family history of genetic defects.

50. An old primigravida is ordered to have amniocentesis at 16 weeks. Which preparation for amniocentesis will you include in your plan?
	1. Witness the signing of the consent
	2. Instruct the mother to empty the bladder
	3. Encourage the expression of fears and concerns

>Women of advanced age may give birth to babies with Down syndrome or other forms of chromosomal defects. The high accuracy of amniocentesis in identifying chromosomal and biochemical defects has been well established. Amniocentesis, a blind procedure, is guided by ultrasound as approximately 20 mL of amniotic fluid is withdrawn transabdominally. Preparation for amniocentesis includes explaining the procedure, consent, and instructing her to empty her bladder, not only to protect it from needle perforation but also to easily access the uterus as the usual entry point of the needle is suprapubic. Amniocentesis is now more commonly used in obstetrics to determine fetal lung maturity.
