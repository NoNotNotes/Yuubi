# Preparation of 4g 20% SOLUTION OF MAGNESIUM SULFATE (MgSO₄)
- Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water or use an alcohol hand rub and air dry.
- Using a 20-mL syringe, draw 12 mL of sterile water for injection. If 50% MgSO₄ is available, add 8 mL of MgSO₄ 50% solution (1 g/2 mL) to 12 mL of water for injection to make 20 mL of 20% solution (4 g per 20 mL). If the concentration is different, correctly mix 4 mg of MgSO₄ into 20 mL.
___
# Administration of Loading Dose of MgSO₄
- Establish an IV line using normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution.
- Using a 20-mL syringe, draw 4 g of MgSO₄ 50% (8 mL).
- Add 12 mL of sterile water or saline to the same syringe to make a 20% solution.
- Give this 4 g MgSO₄ 20% solution IV over 5–20 minutes.
- Using two 20-mL syringes, draw 5 g of MgSO₄ 50% (10 mL) in **each** syringe.
- Add 1 mL of 2% lignocaine to **each** of the two syringes.
- Inject the first syringe by deep IM injection into one buttock (5 g MgSO₄).
- Inject the second syringe by deep IM injection into the other buttock (5 g MgSO₄).
- **If convulsions recur after 15 minutes**, give 2 g of MgSO₄ 20% by IV over 5 minutes.
- To decontaminate: flush the needle and syringe with 0.5% chlorine solution three times; then place in a puncture-proof container.
- Remove the gloves and discard them in a leakproof container or plastic bag.
- Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water
___
# Monitoring for Signs of Toxicity
- Count respiration rate for 1 minute every hour. The rate should be ≥ 16.
- Patella reflexes should be present. Check every hour:
	- Place one hand under the woman's knee and life her leg off the bed.
	- Tap the patellar tendon just below the kneecap with a reflex hammer.
- Insert an indwelling urinary catheter and measure urinary output hourly. Output should be ≥30 mL/hour.
___
# Administration of Maintenance Dose of MgSO₄
- Before repeating administration of MgSO₄, check that: — Respiratory rate is at least 16 per minute. — Patellar reflexes are present. — Urinary output is at least 30 mL per hour over 4 hours.
- Give 5 grams of MgSO₄ 50% solution together with 1 mL of 2% lignocaine in the same syringe, by deep IM injection into alternate buttocks (every 4 hours).
- **Withhold** or **delay** the drug if:
	- The respiratory rate falls below 16 per minute
	- Patellar reflexes are absent.
	- Urinary output has fallen below 30 mL per hour over the preceding 4 hours.
- In case of respiratory arrest,
	- Shout for help!
	- Assist ventilation with a mask and bag.
	- Give calcium gluconate (the antidote to MgSO₄) 1 g (10 mL of 10% solution) IV slowly.
