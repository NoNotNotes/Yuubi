Notes within this folder contain my summary of **Professional Reviewer Dr./Atty. Glenn R. Luansing**'s **Professional Nursing Practice, Ethics, and Jurisprudence**

Naturally, because I am not practicing law, much of the information written is summarized and many aspects of the laws and legal jargon is omitted, trusting their essence would come as "*common sense*" to me or anyone reading them. I still suggest [purchasing the book](https://cebookshop.com/product/8049145) yourself and giving it a read. Enjoy one of the most intriguing (or most boring) aspects of nursing education you will have to face for the board exam.

Additionally, I have also made a summary of Atty. Luansing's [[PALMER-Luansing|Nursing Review Guide on Professional Adjustment, Leadership and Management, Ethics, and Nursing Research]].  The previous book is actually re-summarized within this one, so you can skip straight to it. Many of the topics overlap.
