title: Growth and Development
description: Growth is the increase in physiologic paramaters of size (weight), height, and circumferencial parameters (head, chest, and abdominal) that occurs primarily in the first 20 years of life. Development is the increase in mental, cognitive, and overall capacity to function covering speech and language, body language, self-esteem, motor development, and sensory development.

**Growth and Development** is a series of increases in physiologic and functional capacities of an individual. All individuals are born with the capability to grow and develop as this process is **innate** in each person.

**Growth** is a **quantitative** increase in physiologic **size** (weight, the best indicator of growth), **height**, and **circumferences** (head, chest, and abdominal circumferences). This primarily occurs within the first 20 years of life, most rapidly during infancy and during the growth spurt of adolescence.

**Development** is a **qualitative** increase in functional capacity occurring **throughout life**, broadly in terms of **speech and language** (known words), **body language** (gesticulation), **self-esteem** (valuing of the self; see [[#Theories of G&D|Theories of Growth and Development]]), **motor development** (ability to utilize the body e.g. turning over, lifting the head, crawling, standing, etc.), and **sensory development** (development of the five senses; the first of which present at birth is the tactile sense).
- **Learning** primarily occurs through the senses at birth; the infant who does not understand language will learn that an object is "*hot*" and "*should not be touched*" when they experience pain upon touching a heated kettle.
- While development is continuous and life-long, there are **critical periods** that appear throughout life that can alter the development of an individual. These are encountered as **developmental tasks**.

# Principles of G&D
1. **G&D is innate**. All individuals are capable of experiencing maturation from birth.
2. **G&D is predictable**. It occurs in a regular, systematic pattern in most individuals.
3. **G&D is varied in pacing** between individuals. While the pattern of G&D remains consistent, some may experience growth and development at a faster or slower rate than others.
4. **G&D is affected and limited by heredity**. Those born of taller individuals may grow in size more and in a faster pace, and those born from intelligent parents may excel in academics.
5. **G&D is affected by the environment and nutrition**. Lifelong or temporary delays or limitations may occur due to a lack of nutrition, exposure to harmful elements, socioeconomic conditions, etc.
6. **G&D is limited**. The increasing parameters have natural limits after which no further growth or development can continue to occur.
7. **Critical moments** occur throughout maturation. Growth is most rapid in infancy and during growth spurts in adolescence, and development undergoes various stages from infancy to old age.

# Patterns of G&D
1. **Cephalocaudal**: G&D occurs in a cephalocaudal pattern even in-utero as exemplified by the head circumference being larger than the body at birth. Another example is how the toddler lifts the head before lifting the torso.
	- The head circumference (HC) is normally bigger than the body (CC/AC) only for the **first year of age**. Generally, **HC>CC/AC** in the first year, **HC≈CC/AC** in the second year, and **CC/AC>HC** afterwards.
2. **Proximodistal**: central areas of the body develop before the distal parts, e.g., the arms before the hands, and the hands before the fingers.
3. **Gross-Refined**: gross movements (grasping things with the hands; palmar grasp) is achieved earlier than refined movements (picking things up with fingers; pincer grasp)
4. **Simple-Complex**: similar to the previous number, but in relation to the cognitive aspect of a task. For example, a child is able to untie a shoelace before being able to tie a shoelace.
5. **General-Specific**: in relation to nouns and names, children are able to remember common names (mama, papa) before proper names.

# Theories of G&D
The following theories are those related to the social, sexual, cognitive, and moral development of an individual. While these are also discussed in the [[#Growth and Development Stages]], these are complete explanations of each stage based on our lecture from Psychiatric Nursing on [[02-4|Therapeutic Theories in Psychiatric Nursing Practice]]

1. **Psychosocial Development Theory** (Erik Erikson): each stage is discussed in

| **School-age** | Conventional       | Peers, Teacher    | The child conforms to **social standards/norms** as presented by their teachers and displayed by their peers.                                     |
| **Adolescent** | Postconventional   | Peer Group        | Morality becomes **internally defined** in terms of principles and values. However, this may be bent by **peer pressure**.                        |

# Growth and Development Stages
## Infants
Infants are children from 0 to 1 year old. Their mnemonic is **GOATS**:
1. **Grows very fast**: an infant **doubles** their weight by **6 months**, **triples** their weight by **12 months**, and **quadruples** their weight by **2 years**.
2. **Oral**: according to the psychosexual theory, the infant's needs manifest **orally**; the mouth is the site of gratification and exploration. If a child's oral needs are not met, **thumb sucking** becomes a habit.
3. **Amoral**: the infant cannot differentiate right from wrong.
4. **Trust vs. Mistrust**: according to the psychosocial theory, **trust is established if needs are consistently met**. Otherwise, mistrust remains present.
	- The infant conveys their needs by needs of **crying**. Crying can signify **hunger, discomfort, pain, or even attention-seeking**.
	- **Mistrust** can be identified by **stranger anxiety**. Normally, it appears around 6 months of age, peaks by 9 months, and fades by 12 months. This is related to the developing **object permanence** of an infant at around 6 months, as they are able to remember the face of their primary caregiver and differentiate them from other individuals.
5. **Solitary**, **Stranger Anxiety**, and **Sensory**:
	- **Solitary** refers to the type of play used by an infant.
		- A **musical mobile** may be used by **two months**. As, prior to this, the infant is often asleep for brain development.
		- The primary type of toy used for an infant is a **rattle**, an object that makes sound when shaken. Shaking aids in motor development, and the sound aids in sensory development. This is given by **four or five months** as the child loses the palmar/grasping reflex.
		- **Play should not be too big, too small, and toxic, and not contain detachable parts**. Due to them being in the oral stage, infants will almost always place things in their mouth. Moderately sized, colorful (primary colors, red) toys with no detachable parts and no toxic elements are best choices for infants.
	- **Stranger Anxiety** refers to the fear of individuals besides the primary care giver. This begins by 6 months of age, peaks by 9 months of age, and fades by 12 months of age.
	- **Sensory** refers to the primary method for learning/cognitive development. This is part of the **sensorimotor** stage of Jean Piaget's cognitive development theory that is most predominant in infancy.

Another important milestone of infancy is the **readiness for solid foods** or complementary feeding. This is signified by three changes:
1. **Sits without support**. This also coincides with the development of the cardiac sphincter (lower esophageal sphincter) which indicates the stomach's ability to retain ingested contents. 

| Age          | Motor Milestones                                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **0 mo.**    | Head is lifted 0° when prone (cause of asphyxia) |

| **2nd mo.**  | Head is lifted 30°                               |
| **3rd mo.**  | Head is lifted 45°                               |
| **4th mo.**  | Head is lifted >45°                              |
| **6th mo.**  | Sits with support                                |

| **3 y.o.**   | Child climbs stairs with alternating steps       |
2. **Teething**: the growth of the first deciduous teeth from six months of age (start brushing with soft bristled toothbrush) onwards, often completed between 2 ½ – 3 years of age (first dental appointment), which are then replaced by permanent teeth.

| Age              | Teething                                                                            |

| **9 mo.**        | Deciduous Upper Lateral Incisors                                                    |
| **10 mo.**       | Deciduous Lower Lateral Incisors                                                    |
| **12 mo.**       | Deciduous First Molars                                                              |
| **18 mo.**       | Deciduous Canine                                                                    |
| **2 ½ – 3 y.o.** | All 20 deciduous teeth are present (start dental appointments)                      |
| **6 y.o.**       | Permanent First Molars                                                              |
| **7 y.o.**       | Permanent Central Incisors                                                          |
| **8 y.o.**       | Permanent Lateral Incisors                                                          |
| **9 y.o.**       | Permanent First Premolars                                                           |
| **10 y.o.**      | Permanent Second Premolars                                                          |

| **12 y.o.**      | Permanent Second Molars                                                             |
| **18 y.o.**      | Permanent Third Molars (Wisdom Teeth) (32 in total, 28 if wisdom teeth are removed) |
3. **Disappearance of Extrusion Reflex**: in conjunction with the development of the cardiac sphincter (lower esophageal sphincter), the extrusion reflex (tongue pushes out solid food placed into the mouth) is lost.

> [!TIP] Nutrition in Children
> **Once ready to feed, the diet progresses in the order of the following**:
> 1. **Iron-Fortified Cereals**: prevents anemia
> 2. **Vegetables then Fruit**: easy to chew, e.g., boiled and mashed
> 	- Potatoes, carrots, chayote (*sayote*), calabaza (*kalabasa*), papaya
> 	- Not too many bananas or apples (constipating) or ripe mango (may cause prickly heat)
> 	- Ripe papayas (anti-constipation), pear, peach
> 3. **Meat**: chicken and pork are boiled, shredded, then chopped. Fish may be boiled, steamed, and mashed.
> 	- Chicken liver is soft and is good for infants. This may be found in tinola.
> 	- Hard boiled egg yolk without the egg whites (contains albumin; may cause allergy)
> 
>**Complementary feeding** is began by 6 months. Breastfeeding is exclusive until the 6th month but is recommended to continue until 2 years of age. The diet is as stated above.
>- Wean the child from **breast to bottle** by 6 months.
>- Wean the child from **bottle to cup** by 12 months.

## Toddler
Toddlers are children from 1 to 3 years old. Their mnemonic is **PRAISE** for the items listed below, but also because **praise is the best form of reward for toddlers**. This enforces independence and stimulation of motor development and environmental exploration. All-in-all, this builds **autonomy**.
1. **Parallel**, **Push-Pull**, **Parents**
	- **Parallel**: toddlers play alongside other children, but by themselves; parallel. This is because toddlers often become selfish and jealous of others' toys.
	- **Push-pull** toys are the toy of choice for children, especially as they are in their **sensorimotor** (motor) stage.
	- **Parents** are the significant other of a toddler.
2. **Rituals**/**Routines**, **Regression**, **Rivalry**
	- **Rituals**/**Routines** are useful in caring for a toddler. "*Childhood rituals*" are those involving objects that serve as ceremonial objects. These are **security objects** such as blankets, pillows, and plushies that allows the toddler to settle into a sense of safety before sleeping.
		- The parents are responsible for introducing good, healthy rituals once they observe that the toddler has begun using rituals, e.g., a kiss, handwashing, or toothbrushing.
		- Routines are also utilized for **toilet training**.
	- **Regression** is the most common coping mechanism used in toddlerhood. It is the devolvement back into previous stages of development— loss of bladder control (enuresis) is a primary form of regression.
	- **Rivalry between siblings** is very common in toddlers for attention with parents. This is enhanced by the toddler's selfishness and egocentrism in this stage. When asked to cooperate, they also display negativism.
3. **Autonomy vs. Shame and Doubt**, **Anal**
	- **Autonomy vs. Shame and Doubt** is the psychosocial stage a child encounters in toddlerhood. The parents allow the toddler to **explore**, **provide praise**, and **provide simple decision-making opportunities**. This develops autonomy— independence.
	- **Anal** is the psychosexual stage a child encounters in toddlerhood. The site of gratification is the anus.
4. **Involve the parents in the care of the toddler**
5. **Separation Anxiety**, **Sensorimotor**, **Selfish**
	- **Separation anxiety**: the toddler whose significant others are their parents will only feel secure with the presence of at least one parent in the household. If the parents will leave, the toddler will (1) **protest** against the parents from leaving, (2) **despair** as the toddler feels abandoned or threatened by their perceived solitude, (3) **denial**, and eventual (4) **recovery**.
6. **Environment**/**Explorer**, **Elimination**, **Egocentric**
	- **Environment**/**Explorer**: the toddler will like to explore the environment at this age, in conjunction with their autonomy. This is a good time to make sure the environment is clear of any potential hazards such as poisonous substances.
	- **Elimination**: **toilet training** begins and is completed in toddlerhood. The best indicator for the initiation of toilet training is **walking well**. This signifies that the anal sphincter is developed well enough for bowel control. Additionally, **remaining dry for long periods** (holding it in) and **identifying wetness** (pointing out when the child has voided or defected in their diaper) are positive indicators for toilet training.
		- **Bowel training**: obtain a **potty chair** for the child. In line with the rituals and routines, bowel training should be done at the (1) **same time every day**, with (2) **no distractions** like food, toys, television, or any playmates.
		- **Bladder training**: **avoid fluids** (30 – 60 minutes) **and urinate** (just before) **before going to bed**. The child is taught how to use the restroom by themself, first accompanied then slowly alone (accompany to bathroom, then outside the bathroom, then outside the hallway, etc.)

| Elimination | Begin        | Gain Control |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| **Bowel**   | 1 ½ – 2 y.o. | 2 ½ – 3 y.o. |
| **Bladder** | 2 ½ – 3 y.o. | 3 – 5 y.o.   |

With the development of autonomy, the toddler becomes:
1. **Selfish**, **Egocentric**: the child focuses on their self and their needs and wants. Along with this, the toddler is normally jealous.
2. **Manipulative**: they manipulate for their wants and needs.
3. **Frustrated**: with (reasonable) non-fulfillment of the toddler's wants, the toddler becomes frustrated. With the inability to express this frustration, the toddler expresses frustration non-verbally.
	- **The primary method of expressing frustration is through temper tantrums**. The action to take for temper tantrums is to **ignore the behavior while maintaining safety**. Reacting to the tantrum may indicate to the toddler that temper tantrums will result in the parents succumbing to their needs or otherwise attract attention, either positive or negative.
4. **Negativistic**: the toddler will like to say no, and hate being told no.
	- In the context of sharing, the toddler will often say no. The parent should encourage sharing, but not force it. If the toddler does so, **praise** the behavior.

The theme of toddlers is **Holding On and Letting Go**: (*this wasn't expanded upon all too much*)
1. **Holding onto toys and food**: toddlers are selfish, and are commonly jealous of others' toys. This is the reason for **parallel play**. Each child will have their own toy to play with.
2. **Holding onto stool**: the toddler begins to hold in their stool, prolonging periods of dryness. This is one of the indicators for beginning toilet training in toddlerhood.
## Preschool
Preschoolers are children from 3 to 6 years old. Their mnemonic is **MAGIC**:
1. **Mutilation** or castration, a primary fear of preschoolers.
2. **Associative Play**: the type of play utilized by the preschooler as they undergo their **imitative** and **imaginative** phase; **role-modeling** is exemplified by the child playing "**pretend games**" through **play sets**— doll houses, kitchen sets, medical sets, etc. They can also play with puzzle sets.
	- Preschoolers become more comfortable with **sharing** (expanding significant others)
3. **Guilt**: the developmental outcome of failure to establish **initiative**.
4. **Initiative**, **Imitator**, **Imaginative**
	- **Initiative**: the primary developmental task of a preschooler. The development of trust in infancy, then autonomy in toddlerhood lead to **initiative**, a sense for doing things proactively. Otherwise, **guilt** develops. To aid in developing this sense of initiative, the preschooler is **supported and allowed to try**.
	- **Imaginative**: the preschooler is highly imaginative, giving rise to their way to play, fears (supernatural), and even the presence of an **imaginary friend** to fulfill emotional needs.
		- Additionally, the child begins to **tell tall tales**. The parent should **correct these tales** in private with the child as this behavior can persist.
5. **Curiosity** is strong, in conjunction with and as a motivation for developing initiative.

The theme of preschoolers is **To Try, To Make, To Play**. These are all inclusive of **initiative**.
1. Remember that preschoolers have the **family and neighbors** as their significant others. This is why preschoolers are often more comfortable with **sharing** at this stage, giving way to **associative play**.
2. The preschool child will want to find **meaning** behind the things around them— a **procedural** focus. Their favorite question to use is "**Why?**"
3. **To develop a sense of initiative and confidence, allow the preschool to try**. The preschooler will desire to try things, often out of curiosity rather than an actual willingness to perform the activity. For example, a preschooler will want to try sweeping if they observe their parents sweeping, and the parents should support this but remember that this is only an attempt; do not discourage, demean, or shut off the child.
4. The preschooler begins to **differentiate sexes** in the **phallic stage** of Sigmund Freud's psychosexual stages. This gives rise to (a) **gender orientation**, and (b) **curious masturbation**.
	- The genitals are one of the primary targets of the child's **fears of castration or mutilation**.
	- This also gives rise to the **Oedipal** (maternal attachment) and **Electra** (paternal attachment) complexes, where the child is attracted to the parent of the opposite sex. This should equalize or reverse in normal development.
5. The preschooler also develops ideas of today vs. tomorrow, and inside vs. outside.
## School-age
School-age children are children from 6 to 12 years old. Their mnemonic is **DIMPLE**:
1. **Death**: awareness of the reality of death and mortality causes school-age children to fear death. Additionally, these children also fear **intimidating teachers**.
2. **Industry vs. Inferiority**: the school-age child is exposed to the academic system where competition and ranking arise formally and informally. The developmental task is to establish **industry** (productivity, competence) to find validation from their teachers and to establish an ego as a capable student which if unfulfilled can result in feelings of **inferiority**. The development of industry is **supported by teaching by the parents**.
	- **Punishment** from failure or **excessive expectations** will also result in failure to develop industry and a strengthened feeling of inferiority.
3. **Modesty**: the child high values the valuation and recognition of their teacher. Modest behavior (**refinement** of words, actions), being helpful, and being respectful are the methods by which the student seeks for this validation.
4. **Peers**: the significant others of the school-age child shifts from their home environment to their school environment— the **peers**, those of the same age group in the same environment, and their **teachers** from which they derive their feelings of validation and/or fear.
5. **Loss of Self-control**: a problem that results from the child's involvement in **competition**. This is an important time to strengthen the child's sense of **sportsmanship**.
6. **Explanation of the Procedure**: The school-age child begins to ask the question "How?" and takes pleasure in learning how things are done.

Other concepts related to school-age children is that they:
1. **Prefer cooperative games** and, secondarily, competitive games.
2. **Potentially develop school phobia**. For these children, they are slowly desensitized to the school environment by **making sure the child attends school every day**. Initially, the mother may accompany the child at the back of the class, then seated apart, then from the hallway, etc.
3. **May become latchkey children**: children who may leave the home and return by themselves, keeping their own **keys** to their home. This is common in nuclear families where both parents work. This may be a risk factor for exposure to vices and negative behavior.
4. **Experience Latency** in the psychosexual stages, as they focus on the acquisition of knowledge. This puts their phallic stage on hold which resumes in adolescence when the genital phase appears.
## Adolescent
Adolescents are children from 12 to 18 years old. Their mnemonic is **PAIRS**:
1. **Peer group**: the adolescent shifts their focus to their peer group, their troupe of main friends. The adolescent may also find their first proper romantic partners.
2. **Acceptance of bodily changes**: a major prerequisite to the identity of an adolescent.
3. **Identity**: discussed below ↓
4. **Role confusion**, **Role diffusion**, **Rejection**:
	- **Rejection** one of the primary fears of adolescents.
5. **Separation from peer group**: another primary fears of adolescents.

Adolescents undergo the:
1. **Identity vs. Role Confusion** stage of psychosocial development by Erik Erikson places the adolescent in a period of finding the self and one's place in their environment and group. Part of this task is to accept the bodily changes that occur in adolescence.
	- An **identity crisis** is not only about sexuality. It may span to familial roles and career options, etc.
	- If a child takes the role of the father in a household where the father has absconded, **role confusion** occurs.
	- A child forced into a specific career path, being forced into an identity they do not wish to be in, undergoes **role diffusion**.
2. **Genital** stage of psychosexual development by Sigmund Freud. The individual moves from gender orientation in the Phallic stage to **sexual orientation**. Masturbation moves from curiosity to an actual sexual activity, and sexual activity with others may appear.
