>[!TIP] This is mainly a review of important concepts for the board exam rather than a comprehensive, structured lecture.

___
# Obstetrics
1. **Ovulation** occurs two weeks before a menstruation
2. Calculating **the fertile window**
3. **Uterine contraction waveform**: increment, acme (peak), and decrement
	- When are you going to take the blood pressure of the woman? **During relaxation**. In contractions, blood pressure increases and may return a falsely high reading.
	- What period improves uteroplacental perfusion? **During relaxation**. Constrictions produce vasoconstriction, reducing blood and oxygen supply to the placenta.
4. **Fetal Parameters**:
	- Pulse rate should **not** go below 100 BPM. If it does, fetal distress is present.
		- **Decelerations**: slowing of the fetal heart rate. Uterine contractions **normally decreases** fetal heart rate, starting with the increment (e.g. 140 to 135), slowing at most in acme (e.g. down to 110), and recovering during decrement. In actual labor, there are three types:
			- **Early Decelerations**: FHR immediately slows down upon the onset of a contraction. A **normal** finding; this is likely due to head compression from contraction.
			- **Late Decelerations**: FHR continues going down even during decrement. This may be caused by **uteroplacental insufficiency**; an **abnormal finding**.
			- **Variable Decelerations**: the FHR changes in any period, even during relaxation. This is unrelated to uterine contractions. This may be caused by **cord compression**; an **abnormal finding**. This, along with late decelerations, is intervened by (a) **left lateral positioning**, (b) **oxygen via face mask**, and (c) **cessation of oxytocin**.
	- Weight: 2,500 grams to 4,000 grams upon birth
5. **Oxytocic and Tocolytic Drugs**:
	- **Oxytocic**: syntocinon, pitocin, oxytocin, methergine.
		- **Methergine** is **no longer used**. It produces sustained contractions, which is likely to produce placental retention and postpartum hypertension.
		- **Oxytocin** is given one minute after the baby is delivered. This produces rhythmic contractions.
		- **Pitocin** and **Syntocinon** are given through infusion, and **augment labor**. These are likely to cause **uterine atony**.
	- **Tocolytic**: duvadilan, bricanyl (terbutaline)
		- **Bricanyl** is also a bronchodilator as a secondary effect.
6. **Bishop's Scoring** for induction and augmentation of labor. **Induction** is often done for postterm infants. **Augmentation** is used for prolonged labor. Both are done with oxytocic drugs (Pitocin, Syntocinon)
	- The minimum score required for induction is **8**.
	- If the score is less than eight, the doctor is often concerned about the cervical consistency as it affects both dilatation and effacement. The doctor can ripen the cervix by using (1) **prostaglandin gel** and (2) **cytotec** (1/4th tablet given with 100 mcg/tab inserted as a suppository).
	- For **cervical dilatation**, a **laminaria tent** may be used: a cone-shaped tent is inserted into the cervix, which absorbs moisture and expands, forcing the cervix to dilate.
	- CBQ: highest score (13), minimum score for induction (8), required proficiency (IE), intervention for firm consistency (prostaglandin gel, cytotec), and intervention for dilatation (laminaria tent)

| Criteria                 |     0     |   1    |    2     |  3   |
| ------------------------ | :-------: | :----: | :------: | :--: |
| **Cervical Dilatation**  |     0     |  1-2   |   3-4    | 5-6  |
| **Cervical Effacement**  |   0-30%   | 40-50% |  60-70%  | 80%+ |
| **Fetal Station**        |    -3     |   -2   |   -1-0   |  1+  |
| **Cervical Consistency** |   Firm    | Medium |   Soft   |  -   |
| **Cervical Position**    | Posterior | Middle | Anterior |  -   |
7. **Prenatal Checkup**: importantly **facility-based**, done at least **four times**. It is done to **reduce both maternal and neonatal mortality rates by 40\%**. ENC and the subsequent EINC were both done for these goals.
	- Risk factors: age (<18, >35 y.o.), height (<5"), weight (<90, >150 lbs)
		- **Age**: hypertension, IUGR and SGA
		- **Height**: cephalocaudal disproportion
		- **Weight**: a woman, especially those with diabetes, may deliver an LGA baby.
			- **Diabetic women are recommended to deliver earlier** NOT because of the risk for LGA, but rather because of the risk for **neurologic impairment** from fetal ketosis in mothers with poor glycemic control.
			- Pregnancies with diabetes primarily utilize **diet and exercise** over insulin to control their blood sugar.
8. **Discomforts During Pregnancy**:
	- **Morning Sickness**: nausea and vomiting in the morning caused by hCG (primarily) and estrogen. Intervention: crackers before arising in the morning
	- **Supine Hypotensive Syndrome** (Vena Caval Syndrome): (systolic) hypotension from compression of the inferior vena cava by the gravid uterus of 20 to 30 mm Hg. Intervention: **left-lateral position**.
	- **Edema and Varicosities**: **edema** is caused by **increased progesterone**, which increases **aldosterone** (salt-saving hormone). **Varicosities** are caused by the pressure of the uterus on femoral veins. Management: by (a) **elevating the legs**, and (b) **knee-high stockings**.
	- **Leg Cramps** occurs during the **seventh month of pregnancy** as calcium is used by the fetus for **bone ossification**. Management: **dorsiflex the foot and extend the knee** (hyperextend the affected muscle)
9. **Pelvic Exam**: Rule: **VOID**; empty the bladder.
	- **L1**: Fundal Maneuver- Identify the **lie** and sometimes the presentation of the fetus
	- **L2**: Lateral/Umbilical Maneuver- Find the **fetal back**
	- **L3**: Pawlick's Maneuver- Identity the **lie** and **presentation of the fetus**, and determine the **fetal attitude**
	- **L4**: Pelvic Maneuver/Grip- Done when the fetus is engaged, checked through **ballottement**
10. **Fetopelvic Relationship**: fetal position in relation to the pelvis.
	- just review this part, it's hard to describe without pictures
11. **Estimates of Pregnancy**:
	- **Naegele's Rule**: -3 mo., +7 days, +1 yr
	- **Bartholomew's Rule**: landmark of the fundal height in correlation with gestational age
		- Just above the symphysis pubis: 2 months
		- At the umbilicus: 5 months
		- Xiphoid: early 9th month
		- fill in the rest lol
	- **McDonald's Rule**: FH\*8/7 or FH\*2/7
		- less frequent in the board exam
	- **Haase's Rule**: months squared for the first 5 months, and months times 5 for the remaining months.
		- apparently never been seen on the board exam
	- **Johnson's Rule**: (FH - 11 or 12)\*155 for fetal weight 11 if not engaged, 12 if engaged.
		- spotted once in the board exam
12. **Labor and Delivery**
	- **EINC**: ENC in Dec, 2009 and EINC in May, 2014
		- As mentioned earlier, answering MDGs 4 and 5 (maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity by 40%, respectively).
		- MDG 4 was achieved, but only 20% was achieved for neonatal mortality. This was what brought upon the development of EINC.
		- **Caloric requirement**- 2,000 calories in pre-pregnant, +300 to +500 in pregnant (total of 2,300 - 2,500/day)
		- **Iron requirement**: 30 non-pregnant, 60 in pregnant
		- **Folic requirement**: 400 mcg/day in pregnant women
		- **Calcium**: 1,200 mg/day
		- **Vitamin A**: 10,000 IU
		- **Iodinated salt** for brain development in pre-pregnant women, **elemental iodine** (250 mg/1 cap every pregnancy)
		- **Exercise** (walking, squatting for perineal muscles) **, avoid alcohol and smoking**. Smoking results in IUGR. Alcohol results in Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), which involves neurologic deficiency.
		- **Antenatal steroids**: used to improve fetal lung maturity by increasing surfactant production. Surfactant production begins on the 24th to 28th week; **6th to 7th month**. If given before this period, surfactant will still not be produced.
			- **Indications/Criteria for Steroids**: women with a (1) history of preterm birth, (2) risk of preterm birth, (3) history of vaginal bleeding during the present pregnancy, and (4) those experiencing actual preterm labor. Any one of these can already be enough indication for steroids.
			- **Drugs**: **Dexamethasone**: 6 mg every 12 hours for 4 doses, **Betamethasone**: 12 mg every 24 hours for 2 doses.
			- Betamethasone (Celestone) is given in an emergent situations because of its larger dose, especially if actual preterm labor is present (delivery is imminent within 24 hours). The remaining criteria mentioned earlier can still finish the full course of each dose.
		- **Intrapartal**:
			- When are you going to admit the pregnant client? **Active phase**, when the patient reaches 4 cm of cervical dilatation or if there are 2 to 3 uterine contractions within 10 minutes.
			- How often is an internal examination done? **Every four hours, with a shortest interval of two hours**. This is to prevent infection.
		- **Partography**:
			- There are three aspects in a partograph: the **progress of labor** (dilatation, contractions), **maternal parameters** (vital signs, urine, vaginal bleeding), and **fetal parameters** (amniotic fluid, moulding)
			- **Guidelines**:
				- **Cervical Dilatation** (the center of the partograph) should progress at least 1 cm per hour whether primigravida or multigravida. If a delay is met, the doctor is informed.
				- **Internal Examination** is done no more than five times (q4, no more than q2).
				- **Active labor lasting more than eight hours** makes the client a candidate for CS. Notify the doctor.
				- **Uterine Contractions** should not exceed five contractions in 10 minutes; this is a hypertonic uterus, and the doctor must be informed. These are visually displayed based on duration: <20 seconds are dotted, 20 to 40 seconds are line-filled, and >40 seconds are fully shaded.
				- **Amniotic Fluid**: marked as (a) clear, (b) intact, (c) meconium-stained, (d) bloody, and (e) absent.
13. **Contraception**
	- **Fertility Awareness Methods**:
		- **Calendar Method** (you know this one, -14 -5+3 for regular cycles)
		- **CMT** (Spinnbarkeit, Billing's, Creighton's): fertility is marked by clear, elastic, abundant cervical mucus due to the effect of estrogen
		- **BBT**: an increase in body temperature just before ovulation when progesterone (heat-generating) increases on the 14th day of menstruation (ovulation). This is preceded by a drop in progesterone levels in the 13th day of menstruation (remember 3rd-13th-13th-14th low-high low-high). The change is **0.2C to 0.5C**.
		- **Symptothermal Method**: a combination of CMT and BBT methods to determine fertility.
		- **2-day Method**: alteration of CMT, any occurrence of feelings of cervical wetness within the past two days indicate fertility.
	- **Lactational Amenorrhea Method**: the retention of high estrogen levels (inhibition of ovulation) through exclusive, frequent breastfeeding.
		- Only useable for **six months**. Afterwards, oral contraception may be used as birth control. COCP is contraindicated because estrogen can affect breastfeeding. POP is used.
	- **Hormonal Methods**: ovulation suppression
		- **Pills**: started on the first day of menstruation, artificially influencing the cycle of the woman
			- **POP**: 21 day pack containing progesterone. All pills have hormones in them, and a rest period of 7 days in between packs is observed, where the woman menstruates.
			- **COCP**: 28 day pack containing estrogen and progesterone. The same as POP, but the rest period of seven days is replaced with placebos or pills without hormones. This is still the period of menstruation.
				- Ignoring the rest period or placebos will cause **amenorrhea**, still **in effect for three months** (like in depo provera). The endometrium is shed to avoid it from getting too thick and potentially causing problems (i.e. endometriosis).
			- **Skipping doses**: forgotten on the same day, take it immediately; forgotten from previous day, take two; forgotten from two days, take two, then two tomorrow, then continue as normal; forgotten three days- discard and continue on the next menstrual period
			- **Contraindications**: vasoconstriction restricts the use of pills for those >35 y.o., smokers, hypertensive patients, those with diabetes, those with liver problems, those with heart disease, those with thromboembolic disease, and those lactating. Remember **JACHES**: jaundice, abdominal pain (liver damage), chest pain (heart disease), headache and eye problems (hypertension), and severe leg pain (thromboembolism).
		- **Depo Provera**: protects the woman for three months, the period of which there is no menstruation but with spotting, especially during the first dose.
			- **Do not massage**. This increases absorption, decreasing effective time of protection.
		- **Ortho evra**: not yet been asked in the board exam; this is bought in packs: a patch-based hormonal contraceptive. Three patches each effective for 7 days each are placed on **highly muscular areas of the body** (e.g. deltoid,  thigh)
		- **Implants** (**Implanon**): protects the woman for three years with a 99.98% success rate. This is the best protection from pregnancy besides tubal ligation and abstinence. It is a progesterone-based product. This produces **headaches** and **weight gain** (which is the primary reason for discontinuation).
	- **Chemical Methods:
		- **Spermicide**: the least effective; 80% protection. This increases acidity to kill sperms. A common adverse effect is allergy to the chemical used. This is more effective when used in combination with mechanical methods, e.g., spermicides with cervical cap/diaphragm, or condom with spermicide.
	- **Mechanical Methods**
		- **Cervical cap**: blocks the cervix. These are kept in place 6 to 8 hours after ejaculation and changed in size when the woman loses or gains 10 or more pounds.
			- **IUD**: commonly a copper-based T-shaped IUD that acts as a **spermicide** and blocks the fallopian tubes with **sterile inflammation** effective for **10 years**.
				- The most common issue with IUDs is **expulsion of the device**; **displacement**. This is manifested as a **dyspareunia**.
	- **Surgical Methods**:
		- **BTL**
		- **Vasectomy**: note that this requires two consecutive sperm-free sperm analyses is required to declare sterility.
		- **BRAIDED Counseling**:
			- **Benefits**: hassle-free
			- **Risks**: bleeding, infection
			- **Alternatives**: especially if the parents may still want children in the future
			- **Inquiries** and concerns are answered, such as expectations and costs
			- **Decision to say "No" is respected**
			- **Explain** the procedure
			- **Documentation**: informed consent, consent for sterilization
