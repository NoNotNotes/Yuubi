**Emergency Nursing** as discussed by **Sir Tom Labonete RN-EMT, LPT, Italian Model, Rockstar** on 12-01-2024
___
# Emergency Principles
1. **Common sense**: a lot of individuals feel pressure and anxiety at the scene. Attempt to maintain the intuition held by an emergency responder. Do not forget the basic principles.
2. **Calmness and Patience**: maintain a calm demeanor. Patients can pick up feelings of anxiety especially if displayed by the emergency responder.
3. **The 90-5-5 Principle**: 90% of the focus of the emergency response is delegated to the **safety of the responder**. 5% is for the patient, and 5% is for the bystanders. There is no point in rescuing a victim if the responder themself is put in danger, and may become a victim as well.
4. **Body Substance Isolation, Handwashing**: always minimize the potential for contamination.
5. **Do not treat at the site**. The site of danger is almost never a safe place to perform treatment at. Attempt to make a distance of 50 meters or 100 paces.
6. **Rescue the patient first**. This is a prerequisite for treatment, as mentioned in the previous principle.
7. **CHANT Method**: when asking for help, include the:
	- (a) **Case**, the accident or disaster being reported with the pertinent details of victim count, etc.
	- (b) **Help**, expected required responses e.g. the need for fire trucks, a bomb squad, multiple ambulances
	- (c) **Address**: the location as specific as possible, or important landmarks.
	- (d) **Name**: name of the caller.
	- (e) **Telephone**: the number of the caller for follow-up calls.
8. **Assess dysfunction related to the injury**: the affected body parts are 
## Star of Life
The [Star of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_of_Life) is a universal symbol for medical identification of emergency and first aid personnel. Specifically, its [symbolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_of_Life#Symbolism) represents the six main tasks executed by rescuers all through the emergency chain.
1. **Early Detection**: the use of the senses to determine the presence of an emergency or potential hazard.
2. **Early Reporting**: calling for professional help with the CHANT method; dispatch is connected with victims.
3. **Early Response**: if appropriate, the initiation of first aid response and immediate care to the extent of the first rescuers' capabilities.
4. **On-scene Care**: care provided by the EMS personnel arriving at the scene.
5. **Care in Transit**: transportation of the patient to a hospital for specialized care. Medical care is given during transportation, especially for the ABCs of life.
6. **Transfer to Definitive Care**: appropriate specialized care is provided at the hospital.

>[!INFO] ABCDE
>ABC is done within a hospital setting. The use of ABCDE is done outside of the hospital. The inclusions include **deformity/disability** and **exposure/environment**

 ___
# Ambulance
The following are must-knows about ambulances and their operation.
1. **Driver**: the driver **must not leave** the ambulance. They must be ready to initiate transport at a moment's notice.
2. **Beacons**: the beacon is a **marker**. These are the lights, sirens, and text of an ambulance that marks the presence and location of an ambulance.
3. **Patient Position**: the patient is placed on a **backboard** and secured with **spider straps**. When applied with a c-lock and (head strap thing), it becomes a **spine board**.
4. **Number of Crew**: the standard team is composed of one driver and two crew members.

Ambulances are categorized between two types:
1. **Type I**: ambulances capable of providing **Basic Life Support** (BLS). This involves CPR, bandaging, wound management, oxygen delivery via cannula.
2. **Type II**: ambulances capable of providing **Advanced Life Support** (ALS). This includes tracheostomies, intubations, and other invasive procedures.
___
# Bone Injuries
These take the form of **dislocations**, the removal of a joint from its anatomical position, and **fractures**, the breakage of the continuity of a bone.

## Nursing Considerations
1. **Immobilize the injury. Do not re-place or stretch the bone**. Treat the fracture the way you found the fracture.
2. **Use an ice pack**: cold therapy reduces swelling by inducing vasoconstriction.
3. **Pulse, motor, and sensory assessment before and after splinting**. The presence of a pulse indicates that vascular damage is not present. Pulse is checked distal to the injury. Motor ability is checked by asking the patient to move the digits distal to the injury, and sensory assessment is done by checking for sensation.
4. **Splinting**: the placement of an immobilizing object; anything hard enough to support an injury.
	- **Joint fracture**: bandage from bone-to-bone proximal and distal to the injury.
	- **Bone fracture**: bandage from joint-to-joint proximal and distal to the injury.
___
# Hypothermia

| Degree   | Manifestations                                                       | Management                                                                                         |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mild     | Shivering reflex                                                     | Warm the patient with warm food and fluids.                                                        |
| Moderate | No shivering, the hypothalamus fails to induce the shivering reflex. | Hypothermia blanket, as food may be aspirated.                                                     |
| Severe   | Seizures                                                             | Seizure precautions for safety (side-lying), and hypothermia blanket, food may still be aspirated. |
| Profound | Dead or Dying                                                        | Transport to the nearest hospital.                                                                 |
## Frostbite
**Localized destruction of tissue due to freezing temperatures**. The most common areas to be frostbitten are the ears, nose, lips, fingers, and toes. This results in tissue taking a **waxy appearance** (white/pale yellow) initially before becoming **blackened and necrotic** (dry gangrene) if unmanaged. The nurse's management is to soak the frostbitten tissue in warm water until the tissue appears pink or red.
___
# Fainting
Fainting is caused by a temporary loss of blood in the brain. This may be caused by:
1. **Excitement**: extreme excitement can cause fainting. This involves both positive and negative emotions. 
2. **Lack of rest**
3. **Extremes of temperature**: vasoconstriction and vasodilation will reduce blood flow to the brain.
4. **Lack of sustenance** (eating)

>[!WARNING] Warning Signs of Fainting
The warning signs of fainting includes nausea, dizziness, turning pale, ringing in the ears (tinnitus), blurry vision or tunnel vision, sudden feelings of warm and sweat, and feeling faint or light-headed.

## Management
1. **Alert, Verbal, Pain, and Unresponsive** (AVPU) and **Level of Consciousness** (LOC):
	- Check for **consciousness** (alertness) by asking the patient if they are able to hear the patient.
	- Next, **check response to verbal commands** by asking the patient to squeeze the fingers by asking the patient to do so.
	- Induce **pain** (noxious stimuli) on the breastbone, traps, or (muscle between the thumb and index) to attempt to incite a response.
2. **If the face is red, raise the head** to allow blood to circulate away from the head.
3. **If the face is pale, raise the tail** to allow blood to circulate to the head.
4. **Place the patient on supine if necessary**. This equalizes blood pressure and promotes blood flow to the head.
___
# Bee Stings
**Bees** are normally peaceful insects that can become aggressive upon agitation of the bee hive or queen bee. They sting their pray at the cost of their own life as the stinger, parts of the digestive tract, muscles, and nerves are left behind after they sting their pray. Pain, swelling, allergy, or even anaphylaxis may occur.
## Management
**Initially** after the sting, management is:
1. **Swipe with a card** to safely remove the stinger embedded within the skin. Do not press or pull on the stinger.
2. **Wash the site** to clean the puncture site and reduce risk for infection.
3. **Monitor the airway** in case of an anaphylactic reaction that constricts the airway. The patient experiences heat and rashes due to an allergic reaction.

Within **minutes**,
1. **Obtain curved tweezers** to remove the stinger if the initial removal with a card is not done. The tweezers are curved avoid squeezing the end of the stinger where toxins may reside.
___
# Burns
Fire is dangerous because of its heat and the toxic fumes produced by burning materials. For a fire to form, the fire triad (or tetrahedron) is required:
1. **Heat**: sufficient heat is required for a heat to sustain its chain reaction.
2. **Oxygen**: oxygen is essential for the chemical reaction of a fire. Oxygen is a flammable gas.
3. **Fuel**: fuel is continuously consumed in fire
4. **Chain Reaction**/**Combustion**
## Objectives
1. **RACE**/**ARCE**: RACE is used when patients are inside a burning room, as rescue is more urgent than sounding the alarm. 
	- **Alarm**: (2:14) sound the alarm; fire alarm if present, or call for help if relevant.
	- **Rescue**: rescue any persons or patients in the vicinity.
	- **Contain/Confine**: remove fuel from the room if possible (burnable objects) and close doors to burning rooms, if possible.
	- **Extinguish/Evacuate**: use a fire extinguisher if present and/or evacuate the building.
2. **Airway**: many burn injuries are related to inhalation of toxic gases or burning of the airway, inside or out.
3. **Never Remove Clothes**: burning clothes may adhere to the skin, and its removal may cause the skin to also be removed.
4. **Three Magic Words**: **Stop, Drop, Roll**
5. **Medication via IV**: burns will impair gastrointestinal functioning, making oral medications ineffective.
## Therapeutic Goal
1. **ABCs of Life** (as usual)
2. **LRS via IV**: the infusion of Lactate Ringer's Solution using **Parkland's Formula**.

>[!TIP] Parkland's Formula
>$$\text{LR to Infuse: }4\text{ cc}\times\text{Total Body Surface Area}\times\text{Body Weight}$$
>
>This is given to replace fluid and electrolyte loss from burns from leakage and from direct loss within the first 24 hours. In infusion,
>- The first 50% of fluids to infuse is completed within 8 hours,
>- the following 25% is infused in 8 hours,
>- the final 25% is also infused in 8 hours.

3. **Analgesia**: as pain is difficult
4. **Antibiotics**: due to the risk for infection 
5. **Temperature**: to determine the presence of a fever
6. **Monitor Weight**: to monitor fluid status

>[!INFO] Burn Rhabdomyolosis
>A burn patient will have muscle breakdown. This may be excreted in the urine, giving it a bright red appearance, which is a good outcome. This signifies that the kidney is excreting waste, which includes breakdown products of muscle. In other cases, this may also be another cause of complication in patients, such as in kidney failure.

___
# Poisoning
| Corrosive Poisoning          | Non-corrosive Poisoning      |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 1. Identify the poison       | 1. Identify the poison       |
| 2. Do NOT induce vomiting    | 2. Induce vomiting           |

| 4. Transport the patient     | 4. Transport the patient     |
>[!TIP] Management
>A nasogastric tube is used to perform gastric lavage.

___
# Jellyfish Stings
**Jellyfish stings** can cause rapid death in large doses in some species of jellyfish, or only pain. It also varies in the number of stingers that comes in contact with an individual.
## Management
1. **Pour sea water** on the sting rather than freshwater and urine.
2. **Scrape the tentacles using a card** (remember bee stings?)
3. **Vinegar**/**Baking Soda**
4. **Calamine Lotion**: anti-pruritic lotion
5. **Transport the patient**
___
# Snake Bites
The intervention is to, first, **assess the bite mark**. Afterwards, **wash the site** and **keep the patient still** to reduce the spread of venom, if present. **Do NOT use a tourniquet, as this often causes more harm than good**, as the venom forms potential boluses that are released upon the release of the tourniquet.

>[!TIP] Tourniquet
>Tourniquets are only good for two hours. These are used for **amputations and severe bleeding only**.

|               |    Venomous    |  Non-Venomous  |
| ------------- | :------------: | :------------: |
| **Bite Mark** |     Fangs      | Multiple teeth |
| **Eyes**      | Oval/Slit-eyed |     Round      |
| **Head**      |   Triangular   |     Round      |
![[venomous-vs-nonvenomous-snake.png]]
## Management
Management is **symptomatic**. Different toxins present different symptoms, causing pain, affecting the heart, clotting the blood, etc. These symptoms are managed as they appear. The only actual treatment for the venom is an **antitoxin** from the specific snake venom.
1. **Chemotoxic**: destruction of tissue
2. **Hemotoxic**: causes coagulopathies
3. **Cardiotoxic**: affects heart functioning
4. **Neurotoxic**: causes extreme pain
___
