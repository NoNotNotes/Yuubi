# Rheumatic Fever
An infection involving the heart, CNS, joints, subcutaneous tissue, and the skin caused by Group A Beta-hemolytic Streptococcus.
- Risk Factors: **children with dental caries** (check-up once every 6 months), those who have had **recent or recurrent strep throat**, immunocompromisation
## JONES Criteria
In **Rheumatic Fever**, the child presents with **two major manifestations** or **one major with two minor manifestations**.
1. **Major**: heart carditis, CNS chorea, joint polyarthritis, subcutaneous nodules, skin erythema marginatum.
2. **Minor**: fever, history of strep. infection (ask for sore throat), elevated laboratory findings (anti-streptolysin O titer \[ASOT]), arthralgia
	- **ASOT** Lab Findings:
		- 150 to 250: (inc.)
		- \>250 to <500: Dormant RF
		- \>500 to <5000:  Active RF
		- \>5000: Rheumatic Heart Disease
	- **ESR**, increased during hyperemia.
	- **CRP**, produced by the liver in response to inflammation and tissue damage. This is used to determine both the presence of inflammation and **response to treatment**.
## Pathophysiology
1. Spread of GABHS to the pulmonary system, through pulmonary circulation, to the **mitral valve** (proliferation) of the heart results in the major manifestations:
	- **Carditis**
	- **CNS Chorea**
	- **Polyarthritis**: inflammation
	- **Subcutaneous Nodules**
	- **Erythematous Marginatum**
2. **Mitral Valve Stenosis**: damage to the mitral valve from GAHBS. Left ventricular hypertrophy occurs for compensation. This backs up to the left atrium and pulmonary circulation, resulting in LSCHF. Crackles and moist coughing occurs from pulmonary edema.
	- Lanoxin (Digitalis) increases heart contraction, while decreasing heart rate. This results in bradycardia. **Do not administer Lanoxin if heart rate is less than (adult) 100 (infant), 90 (toddler, 80 (preschooler), 70 (school-age), 60 bpm (adolescent/adult)**. Decreased cerebral perfusion alters LOC.
## Nursing Management
1. **Fever**, **Pain** (polyarthritis), **Inflammation**, **Thrombotic Formation**
	- **Aspirin** fulfills all of these problems within a child (antipyretic, analgesic, antiinflammatory effect, thrombolytic effect). The main purpose is for its antiinflammatory effect on polyarthritis.
2. **Diet**: high calorie, high fiber, low sodium, and soft diet. If polyarthritis affects the temporomandibular joint, NGT/OF may be required.
3. **Polyarthritis**: pain may be produced even by thin linens. A **bed cradle is created and formed as a tent**, to maintain thermoregulation without placing weight on the patient directly.
	- Fractured TSB may be required to reduce discomfort. Avoid the joints, and only pat the patient. Place a moist towel on the forehead, torso, and axillary areas.
## Treatment
**Penicillin** is the drug of choice, combined with erythromycin and benzanthin penicillin.
2. **Oral**: Erythromycin with Penicillin
3. **Monthly injection of 1 gram benzathine penicillin** (twice a month, 500 mg per dose).

# Congenital Heart Defects
**Rubella** is the most common cause of CHD, in the first trimester of pregnancy. The most common complication is CHF. The most common cause of CHF in children is CHD.
## Acyanotic CHD
1. **Obstructive Lesions**: narrowing or obstructions in the blood vessels or valves.
	- **Pulmonic Valve Stenosis**: decreased flow causes right ventricular hypertrophy (compensation), eventually resulting in backflow towards the right atrium, IVC, lower extremities, then hepatosplenomegaly ensues. Management is  .
	- **Aortic Valve Stenosis**: decreased flow causes left ventricular hypertrophy, eventually resulting in backflow towards the left atrium, pulmonary circulation (pulmonary edema). Management is valve placement.
	- **Coarctation of the Aorta**: narrowing often found in the descending aorta. This diverts blood to the ascending arteries, increasing blood pressure in the upper extremities. Characteristic of COA is **Upper Extremity Hypertension**. Manifestations of low perfusion.
2. **Left-to-Right Shunting**: oxygenated blood enters the deoxygenated blood compartments.
	- **Atrial Septal Defect**: increased blood volume in the right atrium, which results in increasing rate of contraction, then back to systemic circulation. Management is a dacron or teflon patch in an open heart surgery.
	- **Ventricular Septal Defect** (most common): eventually results in right ventricular hypertrophy, which reverses the shunt (rarely). Management is patching in an open heart surgery.
	- **Atrioventricular Septal Defect**/**Atrioventricular Canal Defect**: Management is patching (VSD first, then ASD). 
	- **Patent Ductus Arteriosus** (among the most common): a connection between the aorta and pulmonary artery, classified as a left-to-right shunt despite having no septal defects. **Machinery murmurs** can be heard as this is outside of the heart.
		- Indomethacin stimulates closure of the PDA. Prostaglandin keeps it open (used in ToGV to compensate). If unresolved, closed heart surgery is done.
## Cyanotic CHD
1. **Right-to-Left Shunt**: deoxygenated blood enters the oxygenated blood compartments.
	- **Tetralogy of Fallot**: A combination of (mn. PROV) pulmonic ventricular stenosis, right ventricular hypertrophy (boot shaped heart), overriding of aorta, and ventricular septal defect.
	- **ToGV**: transposition of great vessels; swapping of the pulmonary artery and aorta routes. Systemic and pulmonary circulation becomes isolated from one another. A **patent ductus arteriosus** (maintained open with prostaglandin) and a **patent foramen ovale** allow for circulation to persist, even if minimally.
	- **Tricuspid Atresia**: malformation; no tricuspid valve is present. The intake route for the right ventricle is **closed**. This exists with **a patent foramen ovale** and a **ventricular septal defect**, otherwise circulation would fail. Management is addition of an artificial valve (which closes the PFO), then VSD patching.
## Care of the Baby with Cyanotic CHD
These babies experience cyanosis, clubbing of the fingers, polycythemia, tet. spell, delayed physical growth (also in Acyanotic CHD), murmurs (also in Acyanotic CHD)
### Tetralogy of Fallot
1. **Chronic Hypoxemia**: tachycardia, tachypnea (poses risk for aspiration during breastfeeding; prevent with head elevation).
	- Clubbing of fingers are checked with the **camroth window test**, bringing the two backs of the nails together, which should form a diamond window.
	- Immature RBC will be produced by a stimulated bone marrow, acting as compensation. This increases blood viscosity, increasing platelet clotting. Management: **aspirin as a thrombolytic**.
2. **Hypercyanotic Spell**: sudden cyanosis of the lips or fingernail beds; AKA **Tet. Spell**, **Choking Spell**. Management is a **squatting** (ideal) or **knee-chest** position that facilitates impeded IVC flow, which enables oxygenated blood to enter the overriding aorta.
3. **Risk for infection**: frequent hand washing, avoid crowded places, avoid contact with persons with (respiratory) infection, masking when necessary. Prophylactic antibiotic therapy may be prescribed.
4. **Delayed physical growth and development**: high caloric requirements, high fiber (prevent constipation), low sodium (decrease fluid volume; lonalac formula). To promote development, **allow the child to regulate their own activities**.
