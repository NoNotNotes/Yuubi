title: Growth and Development (Sir V.)
description: Growth is the increase in physiologic paramaters of size (weight), height, and circumferencial parameters (head, chest, and abdominal) that occurs primarily in the first 20 years of life. Development is the increase in mental, cognitive, and overall capacity to function covering speech and language, body language, self-esteem, motor development, and sensory development.

**Growth and Development** is a series of increases in physiologic and functional capacities of an individual. All individuals are born with the capability to grow and develop as this process is **innate** in each person.

**Growth** is a **quantitative** increase in physiologic **size** (weight, the best indicator of growth), **height**, and **circumferences** (head, chest, and abdominal circumferences). This primarily occurs within the first 20 years of life, most rapidly during infancy and during the growth spurt of adolescence.

**Development** is a **qualitative** increase in functional capacity occurring **throughout life**, broadly in terms of **speech and language** (known words), **body language** (gesticulation), **self-esteem** (valuing of the self; see [[#Theories of Growth and Development]]), **motor development** (ability to utilize the body e.g. turning over, lifting the head, crawling, standing, etc.), and **sensory development** (development of the five senses; the first of which present at birth is the tactile sense).
- **Learning** primarily occurs through the senses at birth; the infant who does not understand language will learn that an object is "*hot*" and "*should not be touched*" when they experience pain upon touching a heated kettle.
- While development is continuous and life-long, there are **critical periods** that appear throughout life that can alter the development of an individual. These are encountered as **developmental tasks**.

# Principles of G&D
1. G&D is **innate**. All individuals are capable of experiencing maturation from birth.
2. G&D is **predictable**. It occurs in a regular, systematic pattern in most individuals.
3. G&D is **varied in pacing** between individuals. While the pattern of G&D remains consistent, some may experience growth and development at a faster or slower rate than others.
4. G&D is **affected and limited by heredity**. Those born of taller individuals may grow in size more and in a faster pace, and those born from intelligent parents may excel in academics.
5. G&D is **affected by the environment and nutrition**. Lifelong or temporary delays or limitations may occur due to a lack of nutrition, exposure to harmful elements, socioeconomic conditions, etc.
6. G&D is **limited**. The increasing parameters have natural limits after which no further growth or development can continue to occur.
7. **Critical moments** occur throughout maturation. Growth is most rapid in infancy and during growth spurts in adolescence, and development undergoes various stages from infancy to old age.

# Patterns of G&D
1. **Cephalocaudal**: G&D occurs in a cephalocaudal pattern even in-utero as exemplified by the head circumference being larger than the body at birth.
2. **Proximodistal**: central areas of the body develop before the distal parts, e.g., the arms before the hands, the hands before the fingers
