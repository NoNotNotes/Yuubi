# Musculoskeletal Disorders
## Common Musculoskeletal Injuries
1. **Sprains and Strains**: **Ligaments** are  supporting tissue that connect bones to other bones. A **sprain** occurs when ligaments are stretched or torn. **Tendons** are supporting tissue that connects bones to muscles. A **strain** occurs when muscles or tendons are stretched or torn.
	- **Management**: **RICE** for mild to moderate sprains/strains
		1. **Rest**
		2. **Ice** (Intermittently)
		3. **Compression Bandage**
		4. **Elevation**
		5. In severe sprains/strains, **surgery** may be required.
2. **Dislocations**: **joints** are the areas of articulation where two or more bones connect. In any occurrence of malposition (non-approximation) of the joints, they are **dislocated**. This may be complete or partial (AKA *subluxation*).
3. **Arthritis**: **joints** contain tissue that may become inflamed; this is termed as **arthritis**.
4. **Fractures**: a discontinuity of the bone produced pathologically or by trauma.
5. **Osteomyelitis**: an inflammation of the bone
6. **Osteoporosis**: "*porous bone*"; a decreased density rating of the bone, commonly caused by a lack of calcium in the bone.
## Neurovascular Status Impairment
One of the most important aspects of care for patients with musculoskeletal injuries. These are regularly assessed in patients, especially in those with casts and traction.
(*mn. 6 Ps*)
1. **Pain**: often the initial complaint
2. **Paresthesia**: a tingling sensation of the extremities
3. **Pulselessness**: a lack of peripheral pulses
4. **Pallor**: pale discoloration of the skin
5. **Poikilathermia**: a cool feeling of the skin
6. **Paralysis**: often the last complaint
## Arthritis
An **inflammation** of the joints, causing **pain**.
1. **Management**: antiinflammatory medications
	- First line: **NSAIDs** (MIND; mefenamic acid, ibuprofen, naproxen, diplofenac). This may result in ulceration (GI irritants) and nephrotoxicity in long-term use. Second line is **steroids**
>[!DRUG] COX-2 Inhibitor NSAIDs
>These are a recent form of NSAIDs that do not produce gastric irritation. Among its forms, Etoricoxib (**Arcoxia**) is common manifestation
2. **Types**:
	1. **Osteoarthritis**: common in **obese** and **old** patients, where **the major weight-bearing joints** (cervical spine, lumbar spine, knees) **degenerate through wear-and-tear**.
		- **Management**: (1) rest, (2) weight loss in obese patients via low carb/low fat diet, (3) pain management (NSAIDs, steroids \[-*sones*], paracetamol, liniments)
		- **Signs and Symptoms**:
			- **Characteristic Pain Pattern**: morning pain less than 30 minutes. It is localized, asymmetrical, and non-systematic.
			- **Manifestations**: Heberden's (distal metacarpal joint) and Bouchard's (proximal metacarpal joint) nodes
		- **Diagnostic Examination**: x-ray (visualization of osteophytes/spur formation), bone density measurement
	2. **Rheumatoid Arthritis**: a **chronic, autoimmune** disorder that goes into remission and exacerbations. RA is common in **women**.
		- **Management**: pain management (NSAIDs, steroids \[-*sones*], paracetamol, liniments), and the **standard treatment of methotrexate**. Nursing interventions include: 
			- **Splints** can immobilize the affected extremities.
			- **Cold Packs** can help with acute exacerbations of pain.
			- **Heat Application** can help reduce inflammation.
			- **Provide regular activities** to reduce pain levels. Rest increases the stiffness and pain of RA.
		- **Signs and Symptoms**: **fever**, weight loss (painful eating)
			- **Characteristic Pain Pattern**: stiffness that occurs for more than 30 minutes that appears systemically (all joints), symmetrically, and bilaterally
			- **Manifestations**: Subcutaneous nodules, Raynaud's phenomenon
				- In late rheumatoid arthritis, deformities of the hand occurs. From proximal to distal, these are the Boutonniere deformity of the thumb, ulnar deviation of metacarpophalangeal joints, and swan-neck deformity of fingers.
		- **Diagnostic Examination**: elevated ESR, positive Rheumatoid factors (immunologic markers)
	3. **Gouty Arthritis**: the result of a **metabolic** disorder in purine metabolism, increasing levels of uric acid, resulting in the crystallization of gout (**tophi**) in the synovial spaces, causing pain and inflammation.
		- **Management**: **colchicine** is the first line used for acute gout attacks that **reduces pain and inflammation**. Next, NSAIDs then steroids can be used.
			- **Allopurinol** is used to **lower uric acid** by blocking the enzyme for metabolizing purine to uric acid (xanthene oxidase). Colchicine does not does this. In recent development, **Febuxostat** may be a preference in lowering uric acid.
			- **Diet** should avoid purine. Avoid **alcohol**, anchovies, shellfish, oysters, clams, and **organ meats**. Increase fluid intake to prevent nephrolithiasis.
		- **Signs and Symptoms**: pain. A **kidney stone** may also form from uric acid crystals.
			- **Characteristic Pain Pattern**: **monoarticular**; only one joint is affected, compared to OA and RA, which are **polyarticular**.
			- **Manifestations**: erythematous first metatarsophalangeal joint; **podagra**; a great toe.
		- **Diagnostic Evaluation**: serum uric acid
>[!WARNING] Pyrazinamide
>Pyrazinamide, a TB medication, can increase uric acid. This is avoided in patients with gout.

## Fractures
A discontinuity in a bone.
1. **Signs and Symptoms**:
	- **Crepitus**: a grating sound between the discontinued bones
	- **Loss of function**
	- **Obvious deformity** such as misalignment and shortening of the joint.
	- **Pain**
2. **Diagnosis**: **x-ray** reveals fractured fragments
3. **Management**:
	- In an emergency, **immobilize** (external, splint, traction, cast; internal, tongs, wires, pins) **any suspected fracture**.
4. **Complications**:
	1. **Shock**: hypovolemia from hemorrhage.
	2. **Fat Embolism Syndrome**: the transmission of fat as emboli in circulation from leakage of fat from yellow bone marrow into blood vessels, commonly from femoral or pelvic fractures as large bones of the body. The immediate problem with FES is a **pulmonary embolism** manifested by dyspnea, which can result in respiratory failure. Hypotension, tachycardia, and tachypnea all appear as sequelae. The emboli also produces **petechial rashes** on the chest.
	3. **Infection** as manifested by fever, foul-smelling discharge, erythema
	4. **Compartment Syndrome**: a syndrome characterized by **unrelenting pain** (even with opioids) as an extremity experiences pressure such as in internal bleeding (limited by fascia; relieved via **fasciotomy**) or an external covering (a cast) is set too tight. The core problem of compartment syndrome is of [[#Neurovascular Status Impairment]].
	5. **Deep Vein Thrombosis** as exemplified in Homan's sign (pain upon dorsiflexion of the foot)
### Traction
The use of a traction weight and countertraction to immobilize and reduce fractures to assist in healing. There are various types:
1. **Skin Traction**: traction applied over the skin, indirectly to the bone. This utilizes elastic bandages or adhesives.
	1. **Buck's Traction**: lower extremity traction. This is not used with weights more than eight pounds.
	2. **Russel's Traction**: stabilizes fractured femur
	3. **Cervical Traction**: for neck affliction
	4. **Pelvic Traction**: for back pain
2. **Skeletal Traction**: traction applied directly into the bone via pin, wire, or tongs. This invasive placement may result in infection. As such, the nurse **assesses for infection** and cleans pin sites.
>[!TIP] Traction Management
>Never remove weights unless prescribed by the doctors. The weights should hang freely, be free of friction, and free of knots.

Nursing management includes management of the traction system, **neurovascular status** (6 Ps), infection, and complications of immobilization.

| Complication of Immobilization | Management                                                       |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pneumonia**                  | Teach the patient breathing exercises (deep breathing, coughing) |
| **Constipation**               | Increase fluids and fiber (high residue)                         |
| **Urinary Tract Infection**    | Increase fluids                                                  |
| **Pressure Ulcers**            | Assess skin integrity regularly                                  |
| **Contractures**               | Utilize positioning and ROM exercises                            |
| **Deep Vein Thrombosis**       | Checked with Homan's sign                                        |
>[!INFO] Casting
These are hard bindings of affected extremities to immobilize and promote healing. This may use two types of materials:
>1. Plaster of Paris, a slow-drying cast material. White.
>2. Fiberglass, a fast-drying cast material, but is more expensive. This comes in more colors, too.

## Osteoporosis
"*Porous bones*" manifested by decreased bone mass density (BMD). This may occur in patients whose osteoclastic activity (bone resorption) is greater than osteoblastic activity (bone deposition).
1. **Risk Factors**:
	- Being underweight
	- Smoking
	- Alcoholism
	- Sedentary lifestyles
	- Age
	- Diet (caffeine, alcohol, low calcium): should include ~1,200 mg of Calcium per day.
	- Post-menopausal (decreased estrogen)
	- Immobility
>[!WARNING] Surgically-Induced Osteoporosis
>The removal of ovaries (oophorectomy) or testes (orchidectomy) are considered as essentially causative of osteoporosis. The resulting osteoporosis is considered "surgically-induced".

2. **Diagnostic Examination**: **DEXA Scan** to measure bone mass density and **x-ray studies** for pathologic fractures
3. **Management**: Calcitonin, Bisphosphonates, Alendronic acid; all prevent bone resorption (breakdown). The patients are kept upright right after consumption, and are given on an empty stomach.
	- **Diet**: **dairy products**, dark green leafy vegetables.
	- **Lifestyle**: exercise, as exercise increases bone density. In immobilized patients, isometric exercises may be used.

# Sensory Disorders
## Eye Disorders
Also read: [[ANPH/15-1|Anatomy of the eyes]]
### Anatomy of the Eyes
The eye is made up of various layers:
1. Outer:
	1. **Sclera**
	2. **Cornea** (avasular)
2. Middle
	1. **Uvea**
	2. **Iris**, the pigmented ring of accommodating tissue that controls the amount of light to enter the eyes; these cause pupillary constriction (miosis) in the presence of light, and cause pupillary dilation (medriasis) in the presence of darkness. The examination of the pupil with a penlight to detect these constrictions or dilatations assesses the function of **CN III** (oculomotor nerve).
		- Drugs that induce miosis are called **miotics**. Drugs that induce medriasis are called **medriatics**.
	3. **Ciliary Body**: the producer of aqueous humor that occupies that fills the eye. This is implicated in glaucoma when overproduction results in an increase in IOP.
	4. **Choroid**
3. Inner
	1. **Retina**: contains retinal vessels and is the sensory unit of the eyes. These function with **CN II** (optic nerve), assessed with **Snellen's chart** (visual acuity).
>[!TIP] Cranial Nerve V: The Trigeminal Nerve
>The nerve that innervates the cornea via the ophthalmic branch, maxillary branch, and mandibular branch. The reflex tested for the eye is the **corneal reflex**, which causes the individual to blink when a cotton wisp is used to stimulate the cornea.
### Inflammation of the Eyes
1. **Scleritis**: inflammation of the sclera
2. **Iritis**: inflammation of the iris
3. **Retinitis**: inflammation of the retina
4. **Keratitis**: inflammation of the cornea, especially after corneal abrasion e.g. due to contact lenses.
5. **Blepharitis**: inflammation of the eyelidg
### Errors of Refraction
1. **Myopia**: near-sightedness, treated with concave lenses.
2. **Hyperopia**: far-sightedness, treated with convex lenses.
3. **Astigmatism**: irregular curvature of the cornea, treated with cylindrical lenses.
4. **Presbyopia**: far-sightedness that occurs with aging.
### Ocular Medications
1. **Eye drops**: therapeutic fluid administered at the lower conjunctiva.
>[!WARNING] Close the inner punctum of the eye:
>Place pressure on the area between the corner of the eye and the side of the nose to prevent systemic absorption of the drug (approx. 7% gets absorbed).

2. **Eye ointment**
### Cataracts
An increase in the **opacity of the lens** of the eyes. A **progressive, painless loss of vision** is the main characteristic of cataracts.
1. **Risk Factors**: *mn. CARDS*
	- Corticosteroids
	- **Aging**
	- Retinal Detachment
	- Diabetes Mellitus, Down Syndrome
	- **Smoking**
2. **Symptoms**
	- **Painless** blurring of vision
	- **White-colored** or cloudy lens/pupil
3. **Treatment**: cataracts are done primarily through **lens removal** (**phacoemulsification**). This may be done with ultrasound vibrations that breaks the lens into fragments. Patients without lens are **aphakic** (has aphakia). Surgical management is through **lens replacement**, which uses **lens implants** or **corrective lenses**.
4. **Nursing Intervention**
	- Post-op: monitor vital signs, level of consciousness, and dressings.
	- Elevate the **head of the bed**.
	- Lie on the **unaffected side**.
	- **Eyeglasses** will be given for the patient when discharged to reduce glare. At night, an **eye shield** is used to prevent trauma such as scratching.
	- Avoid activities that elevate the IOP: sneezing, coughing, straining or using the valsalva maneuver (utilize a papaya + high residue/fiber diet) to prevent constipation, **laxatives** may be given. **Antiemetics** may be given for vomiting patients. Increased IOP may cause hemorrhaging and pain.
	- Priority after surgery: **safety**. Set siderails.
### Glaucoma
**Increased IOP** (normal: 10 to 21 mmHg) due to an imbalance in the **production and drainage of aqueous humor**. This results in nerve damage to the optic nerve (CN II).
1. **Signs and Symptoms**: 
	1. **Open Angle Glaucoma**: loss of **peripheral** vision (tunnel vision), where halos are seen when around lights.
	2. **Closed Angle Glaucoma**: headache and eye pain present due to higher IOP compared to open angle.
2. **Risk Factors**
	1. **Smoking**, **Steroids**
	2. **Aging**, **Family History**, **High Myopia**
	3. **Diabetes Mellitus**
3. **Diagnostic Examination**
	1. **History**
	2. **Tonometry** through a tonometer, which measures IOP
4. **Nursing Intervention**
	1. Priority Nursing Diagnosis: **risk for injury** due to sensory impairment; ensure safety.
	2. **Keep lights open** to promote pupil constriction. Dark environments allow for dilation, increasing IOP.
	3. Avoid all activities that increase IOP; sneezing, coughing, vomiting, straining, valsalva maneuver
5. **Treatment**: decrease production, increase outflow; the main goal is to reduce IOP to prevent CN II damage, which can result in irreversible blindness
	1. **Miotics**: drugs that constrict the pupil e.g. **Pilocarpine** and **Carbachol**. The constriction allows for outflow to be faster, draining the eye.
	2. **Topical Beta-Blockers** instilled at the lower conjunctiva; **betaxolol**, **timolol**. These decrease humor production Always monitor heart rate to check for bradycardia. Trivia: only 7% of eye drops enter systemic circulation.
	3. **Diuretics**: to reduce pressure by reducing fluid content; acetazolamide (diamox)
	4. **Prostaglandin Analogs/Agonist**: **travoprost**, **latanoprost**; these facilitate humor drainage.
	5. **Surgical Management**: iridectomy, iridotomy used to facilitate aqueous drainage.
### Retinal Detachment
The separation of the **choroid from the retina**, forming a retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) detached from the sensory layer.
1. **Causes**
	1. Diabetic retinopathy
	2. Aphakia
	3. Tumor of the eye
	4. Inflammation of the eye: uvitis (middle layer inflammation)
	5. High myopia
2. **Symptoms**:
	1. **Flashes** of light and sight of **floaters** (light spots on the foreground of one's sight)
	2. Sense of a **curtain** being drawn over the eye.
	3. **Painless blurring** of vision.
3. **Treatment**
	1. **Scleral buckle**, which promote reattachment of the choroid to the sensory retina.
	2. **Pneumatic retinopexy**, where the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is pushed into the retina via the administration of gas bubbles or silicone oil into the vitreous cavity.
		- Importantly, position the patient **PRONE** after surgery to position the gas bubble properly in pushing the RPE to the retina.
		- Avoid activities that increases IOP: sneezing, coughing, straining/valsalva, vomiting (use antiemetics), constipation (use high fiber/high residue + papaya diet, or laxatives as ordered)
## Ear Disorders
1. **External Ear**: ear canal
	- Erythematous ear canal; **otitis externa**, inflammation of the ear canal.
	- The ear canal is normally skin colored. If inflamed, it is erythematous.
	- Aural tenderness occurs, where manipulation of the pinna, oracle, or canal causes pain.
	- Treatment: **analgesics** (otic drops)
2. **Middle Ear**: tympanic membrane, eustachian tube (connects the ear to the nasopharynx), malleus, indus, stapes (ossicles).
	- Problems with the external or middle ear that results in hearing loss is **conductive hearing loss**
	- In **otitis media**, the tympanic membrane bulges and becomes erythematous (normally pearly grey).
	- A consequence of **URTIs** travelling through the eustachian tube.
3. **Inner Ear**: a.k.a. labyrinth; vestibule (semicircular canal), and cochlea
	- **Labyrinthitis**.
	- Problems with the inner ear or labyrinth that results in hearing loss is **sensorineural hearing loss**. Often caused by (mn. LMP) **labyrinthitis**, **Meniere's syndrome**, and **presbycusis**.

>[!INFO] Hearing Loss
>Hearing loss may be **conductive** from the affectation of the conducting system of the ears, **sensorineural** from the affectation of the sensory organ or the nervous system, or **functional** from psychological or emotional blocking-out of stimulus.

### Otitis Externa
Containing the ear canal and other external ear structures, otitis externa is the **inflammation of the ear canal**. Because it commonly occurs after swimming, it is called "*swimmer's ear*"
1. **Symptoms**
	1. Erythematous ear canal
	2. Aural Tenderness
2. **Treatment**
	1. **Antibiotics** for infection
	2. **Analgesia** with otic drugs (ear drops) for pain
### Otitis Media
Associated with URTIs (cough or cold). This features a **tympanic membrane that bulges and becomes erythematous**. Hearing loss associated with this condition is **conductive hearing loss**. If untreated, this may also cause **mastoiditis**.
1. **Symptoms**
	1. **Fever**
	2. **Ear Pain** (Otalgia), a classic symptom of otitis media.
	3. **Ear Pressure**
	4. **Bulging Eardrum**
	5. **Ear Discharge**
2. **Treatment**
	1. **Antibiotics** and **analgesia**
	2. **Tympanotomy** or **Myringotomy**: a surgical perforation of the tympanic membrane used to relieve otalgia by decreasing pressure by facilitate drainage. A repair (tympanoplasty, myringoplasty)
### Mastoiditis
A complication of **otitis media**.
1. **Symptoms**: the tympanic membrane is described as (mn. DIRT) dull, immobile, red, and thick.
2. **Treatment**: surgery to remove infected mastoid ear cells: **mastoidectomy**.
	- If unsuccessful in removing infected cells, meningitis, dizziness, and damage to CN 6 (abducens) and 7 (facial).
### Otosclerosis
Abnormal bone growth at the level of the **stapes**, common in **pregnant women**.
1. **Symptoms**
	1. Conductive hearing loss
	2. Normal tympanic membrane (pearly grey)
	3. Often occurs in pregnant patients.
2. **Treatment**
	1. **Stapedectomy**: removal of the stapes and abnormal bone growths.
	2. Application of **hearing aids**
	3. **Sodium fluoride** may prevent otosclerosis.
### Presbycusis
A form of sensorineural hearing loss related to aging. Hearing is lost due to age because of degenerative changes (atrophy) of the cochlea. Irreversible.
### Meniere's Disease
An inner ear (labyrinth) disorder, where there is an **increased fluid** (endolymphatic fluid) **in the membranous labyrinth**. It is primarily **idiopathic**.
1. **Symptoms**
	- **Tinnitus**, ringing within the ears.
	- **Sensorineural Hearing Loss**
	- **Vertigo** (most common and troublesome due to affectation of the cochlea)
2. **Management**
	1. **Risk for falls or injury** due to impaired vestibular function; **ensure safety**.
	2. **Low sodium diet** as episodes may be related to high sodium consumption, which further increase fluid volume.
	3. **Diuretics** to reduce fluid volume if prescribed.
	4. **Endolymphatic drainage**
	5. **Vestibular nerve resection** to remove vertigo.
	6. **Labyrinthectomy**, removal of the inner ear. Permanent deafness.
