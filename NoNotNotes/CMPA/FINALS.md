# Arterial Blood Gas Analysis
>[!CITE] Origin
>Principles by me, [[CMPA/d/04-04-2024 MS|Interpreting ABGs by Dr. Ferrer]], the popular ROME mnemonic found online.

**Commit normal values to memory**. These are the core of analysis. In arterial blood gas analysis, **pH** is a primary component and is always involved. It is the first result that interpretation is based on. These are the following principles that will help in understanding and remembering ABG analysis. <span style="opacity: 0.3">Trigger warning: chemistry</span>
1. pH determines the acidity or basicity of aqueous solutions based on how many hydrogen ions are in a solution. **Lower pH is acidic** (more hydrogen ions), and **higher pH is alkaline** (less hydrogen ions).
2. **Carbon dioxide** (CO₂) combines with water (H₂O) in the body to form **carbonic acid** (H₂CO₃) which then divides into bicarbonate (HCO₃<sup>-</sup>) and a hydrogen ion (H<sup>-</sup>). This increases the number of hydrogen ions in the body, **lowering the pH**. The reactions are outlined in the following equation: $\text{CO}_2+\text{H}_2\text{O}\leftrightarrow\text{H}_2\text{CO}_3\leftrightarrow\text{HCO}_3^-+\text{H}^+$
3. **Bicarbonate** reduces hydrogen ions by reacting with carbonic acid to produce water and carbon dioxide, the same as in carbon dioxide but backwards. These components are normally part of a system for homeostasis, adjusting to make more bicarbonate or more carbonic acid if the body demands it.
4. **Compensation** refers to the elevation of one component (carbon dioxide, bicarbonate) in response to an imbalance in the other component. The body "compensates" for an abnormal value (e.g., low pH from high carbon dioxide) by throwing another abnormal value at it (e.g., raising pH by increasing bicarbonate). **Uncompensated** readings show the opposing value as normal and the pH as abnormal because of this. **Partially compensated** readings indicate that the opposing component has become abnormal, but the pH remains abnormal. **Full compensation** is achieved once pH becomes normal. 
## Simple ABGs
1. **pH**: **7.35 - 7.45**. Lower than normal is acidosis, higher is alkalosis.
2. **CO₂**: **35 - 45**. Lower than normal is alkalosis, higher is acidosis.
3. **HCO₃**: **22 - 26**. Lower than normal is acidosis, higher is alkalosis.
4. Whichever of the **CO₂** (respiratory) and **HCO₃** (metabolic) readings **agree with the pH** is the result. If both agree, it is **combined** or **mixed**.

>[!TIP] **Mnemonics**
>The **ROME** mnemonic may be used to remember which value corresponds to metabolic and respiratory imbalances: **Respiratory-Opposite, Metabolic-Equal**.
>- In **respiratory** pH disorders, pH and PaCO₂ go in **opposite** directions. As pH goes down, PaCO₂ goes up, and vice versa.
>- In **metabolic** pH disorders, pH and HCO₃ go in **equal** directions. As pH goes down, HCO₃ also goes down, and vice versa.
## ABG Compensation Levels
1. **Fully Compensated**: Read the pH. If it is normal, full compensation is achieved. Identify which region the pH is closer to even in the normal range. Determine the match from CO₂ or HCO₃ to differentiate respiratory from metabolic pH imbalance.
2. **Partially Compensated**: Read the pH. If none of the values are normal, compensation is partial. Same rules as before are observed.
3. **Uncompensated**: If one of CO₂ or HCO₃ is normal, but the pH is abnormal, no compensation has been achieved.

# Coronary Artery Diseases
>[!CITE] Origin
>[[MS1-Ferrer-1#Coronary Artery Diseases|Coronary Artery Diseases by Dr. Ferrer]]

The aorta branches off into the **right coronary artery** and **left coronary artery**. The main problem involved with coronary artery diseases is **atherosclerosis**. It is the hardening or stenosis of vasculatures as a result of the build-up of plaque, and results in decreased perfusion. An imbalance between oxygen demand and supply produces **ischemia**, which can be visualized as ST depression in an ECG, which can eventually result in **myocardial infarction**, which can be visualized as ST elevation in an ECG.

>[!INFO] Read more about ECGs and their leads: [[B418/ECG|Electrocardiography]]
## Angina Pectoris
**Angina pectoris** is chest pain caused by hypoxia of the cardiac muscles. The pain is a substernal pain radiating to the left arm. There are different types of angina:
1. **Stable Angina**: angina produced by **exertion**, and relieved by rest or the use of nitrates (nitroglycerin). The pain is **predictable** and **consistent**.
2. **Unstable Angina**: angina that cannot be relieved by rest and nitrates, and **progresses** in severity and frequency. It is also known as a *pre-infarction angina*.
3. **Variant/Prinzmetal's Angina**: angina that appears most frequently during rest, caused by **vasospasm**.
>[!DRUG] Medications for Angina
>1. **Nitrates**: a vasodilator that reduces preload and afterload— commonly **nitroglycerin**. It is given at most three times every five minutes. It is delivered sublingually via spray or transdermally via patch. Nitroglycerin is photosensitive (place them in an amber container) and expire within six months.
>2. **Beta-Blockers** (-olols) (produces wheezing; given in caution to patients with COPD and asthma)
>3. **Calcium Channel Blockers** (-dipines, Verapamil, Diltiazem) (produces edema)
>4. **Antiplatelets** inhibit the aggregation of platelets. This is primarily **aspirin**, but can also be clopidogrel (Plavix) or dipyrimadole. Because of its nature, monitor the patient for bleeding.
>5. **Anticoagulants** as discussed earlier. Bleeding is also managed.
>6. **Analgesics** are used due to the pain experienced by the client. In myocardial infarction, **morphine** is used.

## Myocardial Infarction
The death of the myocardial layer of the heart, most commonly caused by coronary artery disease. This is known as a **heart attack**.
1. **Risk Factors**: non-modifiable such as race, age, gender; and modifiable (mn. **SAHOD**) smoking, (a) high cholesterol, hypertension, obesity, diabetes mellitus
	- **Dyslipidemia** is an abnormal level of lipids in the blood. Normally, total cholesterol should remain under 200 mg/dL, triglycerides should remain under 150 mg/dL, and LDLs should remain under 100 mg/dL. HDLs, the "*good cholesterol*", should be above 40 mg/dL.
2. **Clinical Manifestations**: the main manifestation is **crushing, substernal pain** that may radiate to the jaw, neck, or left arm, which cannot be relieved by rest or nitroglycerin. Impaired perfusion results in **cold, clammy skin**; **anxiety** and **a sense of impending doom**; **restlessness**; and **diaphoresis**.
3. **Diagnostic Examination**:
	- **ECG**: an **ST Elevation** in an ECG reading is characteristic of myocardial infarction. Prior to injury, **ischemia** produces **T-wave inversion** and after injury, **necrosis** produces **abnormal Q waves**.
	- **Blood Tests**: **Troponin T, I** (MI-specific), **CKMB**, **Myoglobin** (earliest), and **Lactate Dehydrogenase** (LDH; late to appear).

4. **Management**: the **MONA** mnemonic (Morphine, Oxygen, Nitroglycerin, Aspirin) is [apparently outdated](https://onlinecjc.ca/article/S0828-282X(15)01566-4/fulltext), with only **aspirin** as remaining relevant and clearly beneficial for treatment. Aspirin is part of the **reperfusion therapy** necessary for recovering homeostasis in the coronary arteries. These include **thrombolytics** such as **streptokinase**. As usual, monitor for bleeding when using medications that reduce the clotting ability of the blood.
	- If using morphine, **Naloxone** (Narcan) should be prepared in case of oversedation.
	- The nurse assists in **percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty** (PTCA), where a balloon or stent opens up an occluded blood vessel and **coronary artery bypass graft** (CABG) surgery where an extra blood vessel (either saphenous vein, internal mammary artery, or radial artery) is used to bypass the occluded artery
>[!INFO] Patient Teaching
>Preoperatively, teach the client about the importance of avoiding **vigorous coughing**, performing **leg exercises** (embolus prophylaxis), and exercising **incentive spirometry** to maintain lung function. Postoperatively, monitor the client for signs of infection.

5. **Complications**:
	- **Cardiogenic shock**
	- **Arrhythmia**: ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation— treated with defibrillation, except for ventricular tachycardia with pulse.
	- **Recurrent chest discomfort**
## Nitroglycerin
Just repeating this section stated earlier: Nitroglycerin is a **nitrate**. This class of drug produces vasodilation used to reduce preload and afterload.
1. It is given **at most three times**, given if ineffective **after every five minutes**.
2. It is **delivered sublingually via spray** or **transdermally via patch**.
3. Nitroglycerin is **photosensitive**, hence these are stored in an amber-colored container.
4. Nitroglycerin **expire within six months** and should be replaced accordingly.
___
# Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
>[!CITE] Origin
>[[MS1-Ferrer-1#COPD|Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases by Dr. Ferrer]]

>[!TIP] Patient Teaching
>1. The two universal risk factors for COPD is **smoking** and **air pollution**. This is applicable to both chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Let the patient make lifestyle changes to avoid these risk factors.
>2. Always teach the patient about **pursed lip breathing**, which prevents air trapping. In this type of breathing, **exhalation lasts longer than inhalation**.
## Chronic Bronchitis
***Blue boater***; problems with the **constriction of airway due to inflammation**, which also increases mucus production due to mucus gland growth.
1. **Clinical Manifestations**: **chronic coughing**— more than **three months** in **two consecutive years**.
2. **ABG**: respiratory acidosis
3. **Nursing Management**:
	- **Low inflow O2** (less than 6) to prevent the **loss of hypoxic drive**.
4. **Management**: (mn. CAMB)
	- **Corticosteroids** (as an antiinflammatory)
	- **Antimicrobials** (if pneumonia occurs)
	- **Mucolytics/Expectorants**
	- **Bronchodilators**: Salbutamol, Ventril; avoid **stimulants** because of palpitation as a side effect.
## Emphysema
***Pink puffer***; problems with (mn. IBA) **inelasticity of alveoli**, **barrel chest** (increased anteroposterior chest diameter due to air trapping), and **air trapping**. Highly related to smoking.
1. **Risk Factors**: smoking, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, air pollution
2. **Clinical Manifestations**:
	- **Productive Cough**
	- **Dyspnea** at rest
	- **Rales, Crackles, Rhonchi**
	- **Barrel Chest** d/t **Air Trapping**
3. **Diagnostic Examination**: **ABG**, also respiratory acidosis; **CXR** (overinflation)
4. **Management**: (mn. FLA, CAMB)
	1. **Force Fluids**
	2. **Low Inflow O2** (prevent loss of hypoxic drive)
	3. **Administer medications** as ordered
	4. **Corticosteroids**
	5. **Antibiotics**: if pneumonia occurs
	6. **Mucolytics**/**Expectorants**
	7. **Bronchodilators**
## Bronchial Asthma
A **reversible inflammatory lung condition** due to hypersensitivity to allergens. Bronchoconstriction occurs, restricting breathing.
1. **Risk Factors**: **Family History**
2. **Clinical Manifestations**: (*triad for asthma*)
	- **Cough**
	- **Dyspnea**
	- **Wheezing on Expiration**
3. **Management**:
	1. **High Fowler's Positioning** or Tripod during dyspnea
	2. **Enforce complete bed rest**
	3. **Administer medications as ordered**: bronchodilators (causes palpitation, avoid stimulants e.g. caffeine), steroids (increases (mn. BNG) BP, Na, Glucose, and decreases Potassium. Feed the patient with banana or avocado)
	4. **Metered Dose Inhaler** (MDI) with a maintenance drug used to prevent exacerbation.

## Rheumatic Fever
>[!CITE] Origin
>[[05-15 Pediatric Nursing#Rheumatic Fever|Pediatric Nursing, Rheumatic Fever]]

An infection involving the heart, CNS, joints, subcutaneous tissue, and the skin caused by Group A Beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (GABHS).
- Risk Factors: **children with dental caries** (check-up once every 6 months), those who have had **recent or recurrent strep throat**, and those who are immunocompromised.
### JONES Criteria
In rheumatic fever, the child presents with **two major manifestations** or **one major with two minor manifestations**.
1. **Major**: carditis, chorea, polyarthritis, subcutaneous nodules, and erythema marginatum.
2. **Minor**: fever, history of strep. infection (ask for history of sore/strep throat), elevated laboratory findings (anti-streptolysin O titer), and arthralgia (single joint pain)
	- **Anti-streptolysin O Titer** (ASOT) is an antibody for streptococcal infections. In laboratory findings, these are:
		- 150 to 250 Todds unit: Normal Finding
		- \>250 to <500 Todds unit: Dormant Rheumatic Fever
		- \>500 to <5000 Todds unit:  Active Rheumatic Fever
		- \>**5000** Todds unit: **Rheumatic Heart Disease**
	- **Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate** is **increased** during hyperemia (increased blood flow). This reflects a potential infection. Conversely, a decreased ESR may be found in congestive heart failure.
	- **C-Reactive Protein**, produced by the **liver**, appears in response to inflammation and tissue damage to attempt to repair damaged tissues. This is used to determine both the presence of inflammation and **response to (antibiotic) treatment**.
### Pathophysiology
1. Spread of GABHS to the pulmonary system, through pulmonary circulation, to the **mitral valve** (proliferation) of the heart results in the major manifestations:
	- **Carditis**
	- **CNS Chorea**
	- **Polyarthritis**: inflammation
	- **Subcutaneous Nodules**
	- **Erythematous Marginatum**
2. **Mitral Valve Stenosis**: damage to the mitral valve from GAHBS, initially starting from mitral valve prolapse. Left ventricular hypertrophy occurs for compensation. This backs up to the left atrium and pulmonary circulation, resulting in LSCHF. Crackles and moist coughing occurs from pulmonary edema.
	- Lanoxin (Digitalis) increases heart contraction, while decreasing heart rate. This results in bradycardia. **Do not administer Lanoxin if heart rate is less than (adult) 100 (infant), 90 (toddler), 80 (preschooler), 70 (school-age), 60 bpm (adolescent/adult)**. Decreased cerebral perfusion alters LOC.
### Nursing Management
1. **Fever**, **Pain** (polyarthritis), **Inflammation**, **Thrombotic Formation**
	- **Aspirin** fulfills all of these problems within a child (antipyretic, analgesic, antiinflammatory effect, thrombolytic effect). The main purpose is for its antiinflammatory effect on polyarthritis.
2. **Diet**: high calorie, high fiber, low sodium, and soft diet. If polyarthritis affects the temporomandibular joint, NGT/OF may be required.
3. **Polyarthritis**: pain may be produced even by thin linens. A **bed cradle is created and formed as a tent**, to maintain thermoregulation without placing weight on the patient directly.
	- Fractured TSB may be required to reduce discomfort. Avoid the joints, and only pat the patient. Place a moist towel on the forehead, torso, and axillary areas.
### Treatment
**Penicillin** is the drug of choice, combined with erythromycin and benzanthin penicillin.
1. **Oral**: Erythromycin with Penicillin
2. **Monthly injection of 1 gram benzathine penicillin** (twice a month, 500 mg per dose).

# Community Health Nursing
## Primary Health Care
>[!CITE] Origin
>[[PHC|Primary Health Care]]

**Primary care** is the provision of interventions to cure specific conditions of individuals at the level of the community. It is the first level of healthcare delivery in which a generalist like a physician or a nurse renders medical and nursing services for individuals and population groups. It is often the first point of contact of patients in the healthcare system. **Primary Health Care**, in contrast, is an over-all approach to providing people **access to basic healthcare and ultimately improve health of communities**. It operates on three dimensions: a **goal**, a **strategy**, and a **philosophy**.
1. **Goal**: all people are provided access to basic health services, based on the declaration of health as a human right.
2. **Strategy**: it promotes collaboration among all sectors in society, valuing partnerships between public and private organizations.
3. **Philosophy**: it guides public health practitioners to rally communities to assume responsibility for the health.

PHC operates on the traditional cornerstones or pillars of **active community participation**, **inter- and intra-sectoral linkages**, the **use of appropriate technology**, and **available support systems**. They follow the **core values** of **social justice**, **equity**, **respect for human dignity and rights**, **solidarity**, and **self-reliance** in providing essential health services:
1. **Health education**, the primary role of public health nursing
2. **Immunization**
3. **Essential Medicines/Drugs**
4. **Mother and Child Health Services** (MNCHN)
5. **Endemic Disease Control and Management**
6. **Nutrition**
7. **Treatment of Simple Conditions**
8. **Sanitation and Access to Safe Water Supply**
### Elements of Primary Health Care
We've listed the three dimensions, four cornerstones, five core values, and eight health services from PHC. These are all considered in the three **elements** of PHC:
1. **Primary Care and Essential Public Health Functions** as the core of integrated services
2. **Multisectoral Policy and Action**: public health is a multidisciplinary science that revolves around prevention disease, prolonging life, and promoting health and efficiency of populations through collective efforts of all stakeholders.
3. **Empowered People and Communities**: this envisions health **in the hands of the people**, putting emphasis on health as a responsibility besides as a right. Health education and literacy can give people a sense of initiative, instilling a self-reliance in health.
### Determinants of Success
Four critical factors to "Health for all, by all" as outlined by The Astana Declaration (WHO, 2018a) include:
1. **Knowledge and Capacity Building**: information is an essential element of **self-sufficiency**. **Active participation** in planning and developing health programs and services aid in building capacity, fostering a **people-centered healthcare system**. Community organizing (e.g. COPAR) can also identify potential leaders as active partners of health agencies and professionals in promoting health and preventing disease.
2. **Human Resources for Health**: various skills and disciplines are required in community health. **Manpower is the most important resource in healthcare delivery**. This includes nurses, midwives, physicians, among other health professionals.

| Manpower              | Population Served |
| --------------------- | ----------------- |
| RHU/HC Physician      | 20,000            |
| Public Health Nurse   | 10,000            |
| Public Health Midwife | 5,000             |
| Public Health Dentist | 50,000            |
| RHU                   | 20,000            |
| BHS                   | 5,000             |
3. **Financing**: access to essential health services ultimately advance the well-being of the population, but **it entails cost and thus requires funding**. In 2018, the DOH reported that more than half of all health expenditures remain funded out-of-pocket (OOP); directly from the person receiving care. Sin taxes (R.A. 10351, R.A. 10963) are partially used for healthcare funding.
4. **Technology**: the provision of the highest possible level of **wellness requires the access to available services and technology**. Health professionals must employ and equip their practice with technologies to contribute to the goals of PHC. The WHO defines appropriate health technology as **effective**, **safe**, **affordable**, **sustainable**, and **acceptable**.
### Health Services
#### Essential Drugs/Medicine
As mentioned earlier, the provision of **essential drugs/medicine** is part of PHC. These are used to treat endemic diseases, to reduce preventable deaths, and to improve health outcomes. Drugs are considered essential when they are life-saving but can also be used for all population groups. Examples of these include paracetamol and amoxicillin in primary care facilities for common problems like fever, headache, and infections
#### Traditional and Alternative Care
**Republic Act 8423**, titled the **Traditional and Alternative Medicine Act** (TAMA)  institutes the Philippine Institute of Traditional and Alternative Health Care (PITAHC) under the DOH to improve the quality and delivery of health care services to the Filipino people through **the development of traditional and alternative health care** and its integration into the national health care. Today, these methods are called **T&CM**, **Traditional and Complementary Medicine**.

The use of plants or derivatives from plants for the treatment of specific conditions, **herbal medicine**, is one of the most common methods of traditional care. In the Philippines, it is one of the most popular modalities of complementary medicine. Currently, the DOH recommends ten such medicines:
1. **Lagundi**:
	- Use: **Cold**, **cough**, **fever**, **asthma**, dysentery, pain, skin diseases, wounds
	- Preparation: **Decoction**, **Wash affected site with decoction**
2. **Yerba Buena**:
	- Use: **Headache**, **stomachache**, cough and colds, **rheumatism and arthritis**
	- Preparation: **Decoction**, **Infusion**, Massage Sap
3. **Sambong**:
	- Use: **Antiedema**, **antiurolithiasis**
	- Preparation: **Decoction**
4. **Tsaang Gubat**:
	- Use: **Diarrhea**, **Stomachache**
	- Preparation: **Decoction**
5. **Niyog-niyogan**:
	- Use: **Anthelminthic**
	- Preparation: **Seeds are used**
6. **Bayabas**:
	- Use: **Washing wounds**, **diarrhea**, gargle, **toothache**
	- Preparation: **Decoction**
7. **Akapulko**:
	- Use: **Antifungal**
	- Preparation: **Poultice**
8. **Ulasimang Bato**; **Pansit-pansitan**:
	- Use: **Lowers blood uric acid**, **rheumatism and gout**
	- Preparation: **Decoction**, **eaten raw**
9. **Bawang**:
	- Use: **Hypertension**, **lowers blood cholesterol**, **toothache**
	- Preparation: **Eaten raw or fried**, **applied on part** (for toothache)
10. **Ampalaya**:
	- Use: **Diabetes Mellitus Type 2**, increases insulin sensitivity
	- Preparation: **Decoction or Steamed Baby Leaves**

| Preparation   | Procedure                                                                                                                    |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Decoction** | The recommended part of the plant material is **boiled in water**. The recommended boiling time is **20 minutes**.           |
| **Infusion**  | The plant material is **soaked in hot water**, *much like making tea*. The recommended soaking time is **10 to 15 minutes**. |
| **Poultice**  | **Directly apply** the recommended plant material on the part affected, usually used on bruises, wounds, or rashes.          |
| **Tincture**  | Mix the plant material in **alcohol**.                                                                                       |

Additionally, there are numerous other methods by which Filipinos receive traditional, alternative, or complementary care:

## Expanded Program on Immunization
>[!CITE] Origin
>[[Expanded Program on Immunization]]

**Immunization** is an essential public health service and is commonly defined as the process of conferring artificial immunity to population groups. **Immunity** is described as resistance and protection from disease attributed to the presence of antibodies in the blood. The **National Immunization Program** (NIP) is committed to guaranteeing free immunization services and ensures that Filipinos, especially the poor, have access to routinely recommended vaccines. It further guarantees the immunization of **neonates**, **infants**, **children**, **adolescents**, **mothers**, and **elderly** populations as part of the comprehensive strategy for disease prevention and control following the life stage approach. Its goal is **to reduce morbidity and mortality** among infants and children caused by common childhood immunizable diseases. Specifically, the NIP has the following goals.
- To immunize all infants against vaccine preventable diseases
- To sustain polio-free status of the Philippines
- To eliminate measles infections
- To eliminate maternal and neonatal tetanus
- To control Diphtheria, Pertussis, Hepatitis B infection and German Measles (Rubella)
- To prevent extrapulmonary tuberculosis among children

Related laws:
- **PD No. 996** of 1976: providing compulsory basic immunization for infants and children below 8 years old
- **RA 7846** of 1994: inclusion of Hepatitis B immunization for infants and children below 8 years old
- **RA 10152** of 2011: Mandatory Infants and Children Health Immunization Act of 2011 for children up to 5 years of age and inclusion of new vaccines: **Hepatitis B**, **Mumps**, **Rubella**, and **Haemophilus Infuenza type B** (Hib). This repealed PD 996 and is considered the current legal basis of the NIP.
- **Presidential Proclamation No. 6** of 1996: Implementing a United Nations Goal on Universal Immunity by 1990; and **designating Wednesdays as Immunization day**.
### General Considerations for Implementation
1. Remind caregivers of children to comply with the prescribed schedule of routine immunization.
2. **Previous doses do not have to be repeated regardless of interval**.
3. The eligible age for **Pentavalent** vaccines is **up to 5 years old**.
4. Booster doses are not *really* necessary.
5. **Vaccines may be given on the same day, but in different sites**:
	- If through the same leg, space the site at least 2.5 to 5 centimeters (1 to 2 inches; at least two fingerbreadths).
	- **Start with OPV**, **then Rotavirus**, then the other vaccines.
6. Observe the "**First Expiry, First Out**" (FEFO) or "**First In, First Out**" (FIFO) principle in utilizing vaccine stocks.
7. Use **cotton** in cleaning the injection site. **If with alcohol, thoroughly dry before administrating the vaccine**.
8. **BCG, AMV, and MMR have special diluents**. After reconstitution, **these vaccines are only valid for 6 hours**. *This used to be 4 hours*
9. **Protect BCG from sunlight, and Rotavirus from light**. *This principle may be used in questions that ask which location is appropriate for vaccination*
10. Information caregivers of children for immunization about [[#Common Vaccination Side Effects and Management|common side effects]], and how to deal with it.
11. **Reusable vaccines** such as **OPV, Pentavalent, Hepatitis B, and Tetanus Toxoid** may last for a maximum of **4 weeks** as long as the vaccine has (a) not expired, (b) been maintained in appropriate cold chain conditions, (c) remained uncontaminated during aspiration, (d) a VVM that does not indicate discarding, and (e) the vaccine septum has not been submerged in water.

In cases of a **measles outbreak**, a **supplemental measles vaccine** is administered.
- For children **under 9 months old**, give **MR** (no vaccine for mumps) reconstituted with **two vials of special diluent** (6 mL total), giving 0.5 mL subcutaneously to the child.
- For children **9 months to 5 years old**, give **MMR**.

These are **NOT CONTRAINDICATIONS**:
1. **Fever up to 38.5°C** *"up to" means a fever of 38.5°C still permits vaccination.*
2. **Mild acute respiratory infection**
3. **Simple diarrhea**
4. **Malnutrition** *conversely, this is an indication; malnutrition poses greater risk for disease*
