description: A discussion on the frameworks of maternity and child nursing in the Philippines, its legal bases, competencies, and areas of care with an accompanying Q&A from Dr. Pacabis.
date: 2024-10-31
draft: true
---
**Maternity and Child Nursing** in the Philippines covers various areas of care, which includes:
1. Women's Health/Gynecological Clinic
2. Child Health
3. Antenatal Care
4. Labor and Delivery Care
5. Postpartum Care
6. Perinatal Services (Combination of 2, 3, 4, and 5): a generalist
___
# Antenatal Care
**Antenatal care** spans the longest phase in obstetrics, starting with **pregnancy**; the unification of an ovum with sperm resulting in **fertilization**. The antenatal period lasts 280 days (270 to 290 days), 40 weeks (37 to 42 weeks), 9 calendar months, or 10 lunar months
1. **Prenatal stage**: antenatal care starts with **prenatal care**, which is highly significant in the success of pregnancy outcomes. **Without prenatal care, a pregnant woman is considered at-risk**.
>[!SUCCESS] Institutional Delivery
>- All primigravida and grand multigravida women should deliver within a hospital setting, and not within the community even in the presence of a midwife or nurse.

2. **Labor and Delivery Stage**: the shortest stage in obstetrics, normally **only lasting 24 hours**, yet introducing **the most risk**. Prolonged labor introduces multiple risks that the nurse must be alert for interventions. The augmentation of labor (e.g., oxytocic drip) may be started by the primary health care provider. Therefore, the maternity nurse must be **competent** even in low-risk conditions in:
	- The use of a [[10-21-2024 Normal OB#Partography|Partograph]]
	- Performing a **normal spontaneous delivery** (NSD)
	- **Suturing lacerations** with special training, for 1st degree (skin) and 2nd degree (muscle) perineal lacerations
	- Performing **vaginal** (internal) **examinations**
3. **Postpartum Care**: the return to a pre-pregnant state; the *puerperium*. The main focus of observation is the **uterus**, which returns to its pregravida state within **6 to 8 weeks**. Complications can set in immediately after delivery, hence the necessity for strict monitoring.
	- **Immediate Postpartum Care**: the first two hours post-delivery, known as the **fourth stage of labor**. After two hours of the following assessments returning normal results will the patient be moved to routine care.
		- **Assessment** every 15 minutes for the first hour, then 30 minutes for the second hour if found normal, then the mother is moved to their room/for rooming-in.
		- Assessment of the **uterus** should be (a) **hard and contracted uterus**, (b) **at the level of or below the navel**, and (c) **aligned medially**. The primary cause of bleeding is **atony**.
		- Assessment of **vaginal bleeding** is determined through the number of pads used by the mother; a **pad should not be completely soaked within the first hour**. Any more indicates abnormal bleeding of the mother.
		- Assessment of the **bladder** is the third element of immediate postpartum care. The bladder must be **empty** to allow the uterus to return to normal.
		- Assess the **lacerations** and **wounds** for hematoma and infections
		- Assess the **vital signs**; all values must remain within the normal range.
	- **Follow-up care** is necessary to ensure a health transition to the mother's non-pregnancy state.
4. **Child Health**: care of the newborn to the adolescent. The immediate care provided by the maternal nurse in the delivery room involves the **essential newborn care (ENP) protocol** or the *Unang Yakap* protocol.
	- **ENC** was developed into a national program was done to increase maternal and neonatal survival. An essential part of this protocol is to **ensure breastfeeding**.
>[!TIP] Pillars of the DOH
>In all allied health examinations, two of the pillars of DOH are of high importance and value: **breastfeeding** and **family planning**. 

5. **Women's Health**: gynecological health
	- **Vaginal Infections**:
		1. **Moniliasis**: Candida albicans, a fungi, is the most common vaginal infection.
			- This appears as cheese-/**curd-like white vaginal discharge**, **pruritus** and **redness**.
			- The treatment used is **Clotrimazole**, an antifungal medication either orally or through a vaginal suppository.
		2. **Trichomoniasis**: a protozoa
			- This appears as **foul, greenish-yellowish, and foamy discharge**.
			- The treatment used is **Metronidazol** (Flagil)
		3. **Bacterial Vaginosis**:
			- Grayish secretion with an odd smell.
			- The treatment used is **antibiotics**
		4. **Chlamydia**: 
	- **Menstrual disorders**: **abnormal uterine bleeding** (AUB): vaginal bleeding outside of the menstrual period, (b) **irregular menstruation**: may be a precursor to poor fertility, and (c) **dysfunctional bleeding**: anemia.
		- Medical drugs (oral pill symptomatic) or surgery (inc) may be used to treat these abnormalities
	- **Infertility**: the inability to become pregnant for 12 months of regular intercourse. This may be caused by:
		- **Menstrual disorders**
		- **Endometriosis**: the growth of endometrial cells outside of its normal region, affecting uterine, vaginal, or even abdominal structures.
		- **Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome** (PCOS): the development of fluid-filled follicles that fail to release eggs.
		- **Cancer in women**: cancer of the breasts, uterus, cervix, or ovaries are the most common occurrences of cancer in women. The **ovaries** are of special concern, because they remain asymptomatic until it becomes late-stage. **Cervical cancer** can be prevented with the HPV vaccine.
			- **Breast cancer** is personally checked with **SBE**, palpated by a health worker yearly, and checked with a **mammogram** for those at risk yearly starting at 40 years, and all women who are 50 years and above.
			- **Cervical cancer** can be prevented with the HPV vaccine. However, a **pap smear** may be done to check for laboratory analysis to check for abnormal cells.
			- **Ovarian cysts** and **myomas** may be found with a regular **ultrasound**.
		- Fallopian tube obstruction, insensitive endometrium, infertile cervical mucus, etc.
