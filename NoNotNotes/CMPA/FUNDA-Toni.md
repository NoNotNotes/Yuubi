# Module 1: Medication Administration
The administration of medication is a **dependent nursing action**. Doctor's orders are required for any medications given.
>[!IMPORTANT] Fundamental Rule: **never administer an unfamiliar medication**.

## Rights of Medication
The first six rights of medication listed are most important, but otherwise not in any particular order:
1. **Right Patient**: identify the patient with at least two identifiers. For this specific right, take into consideration that there are two categories of patients: conscious and unconscious.
	- **Conscious**: alert, coherent, and aware patients. For these clients, you may **ask the client to state their name**
	- **Unconscious**: comatose. For these clients, you may **check the ID bracelet/band/label**
2. **Right Drug**: there are four elements in checking the validity of the drug being given:
	- **Expiration**: check the date of expiration of the medication.
	- **Color**: changes in color can indicate errors or invalidity.
	- **Spelling**: in written prescriptions, the spelling of medication names should be double-checked. Some drugs can go as far as to differ by one syllable.
	- **Label**: checked thrice; once when receiving the order, second when opening or dispensing, and third when administering the medication.
3. **Right Dose**: **double-checking** is always imperative for giving drugs. No excess or deficit against the prescribed amount should be administered. This is done especially for (a) **multiple drugs**, (b) **sudden changes of orders**, (c) **available stock dose does not match order**. The relevant formulae used for calculating the required dose includes:
	- **Pediatric Doses**:
		- **Clark's Rule**: `Weight (pounds) / 150 * Adult Dose`
		- **Fried's Rule** (12 months and below): `Age (months) / 150 * Adult Dose`
		- **Young's Rule**: `Age (years) / (Age (years) + 12) * Adult Dose`
	- **Adult Doses**: `Dose / Stock * Quantity`
	- **IV Calculation**: `Total Volume / Hrs. to Infuse * Drop Factor / 60 Minutes` DF may be defined as macro (20) or micro (60).
4. **Right Frequency**: the usage of correct intervals between dosages. This is written on the order, with standardized abbreviations. Depending on the institution, the timings of non-specific frequencies can vary.

6. **Right Documentation**: correct recording of medications given immediately after administration. Requisite documentation characteristics include comprehensiveness, brevity, and legibility.
	- Done **after the procedure**
	- Free of **erasures**; use strike-through for errors and append initials and a signature.
	- Free of **superimposition**
	- No blank spaces
	- Utilizes universal abbreviation
7. **Right Client Education**
8. **Right Assessment**
9. **Right Evaluation**
10. **Right to Refuse**
>[!DRUG] Medication Order (MO) vs. Telephone Order (TO).
>A **medication order** contains the name of the patient, the name of the drug, its dose, frequency, and route; the first five rights listed, along with the signature of the prescribing physician. All elements must be present for the validity of a prescription.
>
>A **telephone order** can provide the statement of the previously stated elements, except for the presence of a **signature**.
>- However, the prescribing physician should **countersign the order** based on institutional policies, within 24 hours, or by the next shift.
>- It may also be accepted for **emergency cases**.
>- Additionally, a **registered nurse** must be present to serve as a witness and for verification of the drug. Any unclear info provided should be inquired upon, such as the spelling of an uncommon drug.
## Parenteral Administration
Syringe-based administration. An invasive procedure that can be classified as ID, SC, IM, or IV. Because of its nature, it is considered as the most dangerous and the fastest method of administration. Apply **universal precautions**.
>[!ERROR] Universal Precaution
>1. **Handwashing**. Standard duration is 20 seconds, but cleaning of contaminated skin must be at least 60 seconds with increased friction. Handrubs are also now accepted, as long as the solution used is 70% or greater.
>2. **Never recap needles after use**. They are disposed of immediately, or at least should be recapped with the fishing technique.
>3. **Dispose sharps in a sharps container**.

| Parameter | Intradermal | Subcutaneous | Intramuscular                    |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Length    | 3/8 – 5/8"  | 5/8 – 1/2"   | 1/2 – 1 1/2"                     |
| Gauge     | 26 – 27     | 25 – 26      | Child: 24 – 25<br>Adult: 23 – 24 |
| Angle     | 10° – 15°   | 45°          | 90°                              |

Administration through parenteral means, given its potential risks, should following these principles:
1. **ID**: **Bevel Up**. The bevel of the needle should be facing up, away from the skin. This facilitates the formation of a **wheal** or **bleb**. **No red ink** when marking the site. No massaging.
4. **SC**: **Rotate the site of injection**. This is to prevent lipodystrophy or lipoatrophy. This is the breakdown of subcutaneous fat from repeated administration. The interval between site is at least four weeks.
5. **IM**: **Aspirate** to check if a blood vessel has been punctured, before releasing the medication.

# Oxygenation
**Oxygen therapy** is used to reverse hypoxia, hypoxemia, or anoxia; to increase oxygen levels. Importantly, the following are followed:
1. **Positioning**: the patient is placed on a High Fowler's position to enhance lung expansion, improving the reception of oxygen. This position is used in patients experiencing DOB, SOB, or Orthopnea (alternatively, the orthopneic position)
>[!TIP] In pregnancy
>The position of comfort in pregnancy is a **left-side lying position**. This is a common answer in any question related to positioning a pregnant client.

2. **Precautions**: oxygen is one of the main elements of the fire triad. As such, **alcohol**, **oil**, **smoking**, and other potentially flammable materials or activities are prohibited.
	- An important nursing action is to **place a No Smoking sign** near the bed, tank, or door of the room.
	- Additionally, **cotton clothing** is used as other fabrics can create **static friction**, which is another potential source of fire.
	- In **pediatric wards**, **battery-operated toys** are also contraindicated.
3. **Devices Used in Oxygenation**: oxygenation can be assessed with:
	1. **Pulse Oximetry** (SpO₂): ensure avoidance of erroneous results— reduce light exposure of the area being used for oximetry.
	2. **Incentive Spirometer**: a pulmonary rehabilitation tool used to increase alveolar expansion and train inspiratory muscles.
	3. **Humidifier**: increases moisture of delivered air to prevent drying.
## Delivery Systems
1. **Low Flow**: entry level oxygenation, potentially even usable as an independent nursing intervention in emergencies.
>[!WARNING] Refractory Hypoxia in COPD
>The use of high flow oxygen is **not done for patients with COPD**. These patients do not require the SpO<sub>2</sub> of a normal individual. Their breathing reflex may mainly depend on oxygen levels rather than carbon dioxide levels; a high oxygen flow can deplete this **hypoxic drive**, inhibiting the patient's breathing.

2. **High Flow**: including the use of CPAP, CPEP, and BiPAP

| Delivery                          | Rate        |
| --------------------------------- | ----------- |
| **Nasal Cannula**                     | 2–6 L/min   |
| **Face Mask**                         | 8 L/min     |
| **Face Mask with Partial Rebreather** | 10–12 L/min |
| **Non-Breather Face Mask**            | 15 L/min    |
| **Venturi Mask**                      | -           |
3. **Wall-Outlet Supplemental Therapy**

| Color  | Content                      |
| ------ | ---------------------------- |
| **Green**  | Oxygen                       |
| **Blue**   | Nitrous Oxide (Laughing Gas) |
| **Yellow** | Medical Air; Compressed Air  |
| **White**  | Suction/Vacuum               |
## Suctioning
**Suctioning** is used to remove pulmonary secretions to improve gas exchange; to prevent hypoxia. It utilizes a **sterile technique** as the nurse maneuvers a suction catheter into the airways to remove any buildup of secretions.

| Age Group | Catheter Size | Portable Suction<br>Pressure | Wall-Type Suction<br>Pressure |
| --------- | ------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Adult**     | Fr. 12 – 18   | 10 – 15 mm Hg                | 100 – 120 mm Hg               |
| **Child**     | Fr. 8 – 10    | 5 – 10 mm Hg                 | 95 – 110 mm Hg                |
| **Infant**    | Fr. 5 – 8     | 3 – 5 mm Hg                  | 50 – 95 mm Hg                 |

The application of suction is done while the patient is in a semi-fowlers (if conscious) or side-lying (if unconscious) position. Prior to every period of suctioning, the patient is **hyperoxygenated**. While maintaining sterile technique with the hand manipulating the suction catheter, suction is intermittently applied during withdrawal as to avoid damaging tissue. In general, the shorter the period of suctioning, the less hypoxia occurs.

|                             | Oral         | Nasal        | Tracheal (stoma)   |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------------ |
| **Suction Duration**        | 10 – 15 sec. | 10 – 15 sec. | 5 – 10 sec.        |
| **Rest Period**             | 20 – 30 sec. | 20 – 30 sec. | 2 – 3 min.         |
| **Length of Tip Insertion** | 3 – 5 in.    | 3 – 5 in.    | 2 – 3 in.          |
| **Lubricant Used**          | Clean Water  | KY Jelly     | NSS; Sterile Water |
## Chest Physiotherapy
A series of techniques applied to facilitate the removal of secretions from the airways.
1. **Precautions**:
	- CPT is done **before meals** to prevent aspiration. If not possible, wait 2 to 3 hours after meals before proceeding.
	- Percussion should not be done over **bony prominences** or **breast tissue**.
2. **Contraindications**: PTB, MI, Angina, other disorders of the lungs, trauma, etc.

CPT is composed of three main techniques:
1. **Percussion**: a rhythmic tapping of the back to mechanically dislodge secretions. The nurse performs tapotement on the back with cupped hands in such a way that a popping sound is produced.
2. **Vibration**: a fine, shaking motion applied during exhalation to move secretions.
3. **Postural Drainage**: the use of gravity to move secretions for easier expectoration. Depending on the auscultated areas where secretions are found, the posture used changes. They generally follow a contralateral approach:
	- **Apex of the lungs**: upright, leaning forward
	- **Base of the lungs**: modified Trendelenburg
	- **Right lung**: left-side lying
	- **Left lung**: right-side lying
