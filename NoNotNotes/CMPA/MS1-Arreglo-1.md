# Digestive System
The digestive system consists of a long tube also known as the **alimentary canal** where ingested substances travel and undergo mechanical and chemical digestion for conversion into absorbable units of food for **nutrition**. In conjunction with this canal, **accessory organs of digestion** (liver, gallbladder, salivary glands, pancreas) aid in the digestion of food.

>[!TIP] GIT Subdivisions and Function
>The **Upper GIT**, starting from the mouth to the small intestine, is where **digestion** primarily takes place.
>
>The **Lower GIT**, starting from the large intestine to the anus, involves:
>1. **Absorption**; the reabsorption of water that converts stool into its formed, solid state.
>2. **Synthesis of Vitamin K** by the normal gut flora *E. coli*, which makes up roughly 50% of an individual's Vitamin K. This is **necessary for the production of clotting factors X, IX, VII, and II** (Vitamin K dependent clotting factors). This is the mechanism behind the importance of Vitamin K in stopping bleeding.
>3. **Putrefaction** also occurs, where *E. coli* interacts with fecal materials to produce flatus, a combination of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane, and ammonia

>[!ERROR] GI Bleeding
>**Gastrointestinal bleeding** can occur along any part of the alimentary canal. In general, this is also divided between **Upper GI Bleeding** (UGIB) and **Lower GI Bleeding** (LGIB), which present differently:
>1. **UGIB** gives time for the blood to be acted upon by digestive enzymes and the acids of the body. This converts its color into a dark, tarry form that produces **melenic stool** (melena); stool that is dark, tarry, and foul-smelling, one characteristic of upper GI bleeding.
>2. **LGIB** occurs in the non-digestive part of the alimentary canal, which allows blood to retain its original color upon being excreted along with stool. This appears as **hematochezia**; stool that is red and bloody.

## Abdominal Assessment
Compared to the normal sequence of assessment (IPPA), abdominal assessment follows **IAPePa**: **inspection**, **auscultation**, **percussion**, and **palpation**. This sequence prioritizes auscultation as percussion and palpation can alter bowel sounds when performed, modifying assessment findings.
1. **Inspection**: view the skin for its color, common discoloration signs (Grey-Turner, Cullen's), masses, distention, and contour
2. **Auscultation**: listening for bowel sounds in all quadrants for one full minute, normally occurring from 5 to 35 sounds in 60 seconds. Bowel sounds often change in conditions that involve abdominal cramping, diarrhea, or obstructions.
3. **Percussion**
4. **Palpation**

The abdominal areas may be subdivided into four quadrants or nine regions:
1. **Nine-Region System**: this system divides the abdomen into nine areas using two horizontal and two vertical lines (midclavicular lines). The lowest region ends at the level of the highest part of the pelvic bone (transtubercular line), and the highest region ends at the end of the ribcage (subcostal line).

| Left                  | Middle                   | Right                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Left Hypochondriac    | Epigastric               | Right Hypochondriac    |
| Left Lumbar           | Umbilical                | Right Lumbar           |
| Left Iliac (Inguinal) | Hypogastric (Suprapubic) | Right Iliac (Inguinal) |
2. **Four-Quadrant System**: this system divides the abdomen into four with the midline from the xiphoid to the symphysis pubis, and a transverse cut across the umbilicus.

>[!TIP] Nausea and Vomiting
>The part of the brain that produces vomiting when stimulated is the **chemoreceptor trigger zone** (CTZ). Any stimulation of this zone results in vomiting. Some of these stimuli include:
>- Any inflammation in the abdominal region
>- Any obstruction in the abdominal region
>- Increased intracranial pressure
>- Vertigo or dizziness
>- Anticancer drugs
>- Early pregnancy
>- Sensory exposure to gross or noxious elements
## Inflammatory Disorders
**Inflammatory diseases** share common presentations, and are those disorders that end in "-*itis*". The primary manifestations of inflammatory disorders include (a) **pain**, (b) **nausea and vomiting**, and (c) **indigestion** (dyspepsia).

1. **Gastritis**
2. **Peptic Ulcer Disease** (PUD); A.K.A. **Erosive Inflammation**
3. **Inflammatory Bowel Diseases** (IBD):
	1. **Regional Enteritis**; A.K.A. **Chron's Disease**
	2. **Ulcerative Colitis**
4. **Appendicitis**
5. **Diverticulitis**
6. **Cholecystitis**
7. **Pancreatitis**

>[!ERROR] Pain Location & Associated Disorders
>
>|Location|Disorders|
>|---|---|
>|**LUQ**|Pancreatitis|
>|**LLQ**|Ulcerative colitis, Diverticulitis|
>|**RUQ**|Cholecystitis|
>|**RLQ**|Crohn's Disease, Appendicitis|
>|**Epigastric Region**| Gastritis, Peptic Ulcer Disease|
## Non-inflammatory Disorders
### Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)
Irritable bowel syndrome is a **functional** (no causative structural defects) **disorder** with an unknown cause— an **idiopathic** disorder. However, this has been theorized to be caused by neural or hormonal defects in gastrointestinal regulation.
1. **Risk Factors**: stress, family history
2. **Signs and Symptoms**: IBS is classified as **IBS-c** (results in **constipation**), **IBS-d** (results in **mucoid diarrhea**), or IBS-m/**IBS-a** (results in **mixed** or **alternating diarrhea and constipation**). Additionally the following also occur:
	- **Indigestion** (dyspepsia)
	- **Abdominal pain**
3. **Diagnostic Evaluation**: mainly *exclusionary*, as there is no test specific to IBS. These include **colonoscopy**, **CBC**, **ESR** (elevated in inflammation), **imaging** (UTZ)
4. **Management** is **==palliative==**; symptom-based:
	- **Diarrhea**: high protein (prevent fluid shifting), low residue, high fiber and fluid diet with **fluid replacement** (Oresol). In severe cases, **antidiarrheals** (Loperamide) may be given.
	- **Constipation**: low fat, high fiber diet with increased fluid intake. In severe cases, **laxatives** may be prescribed.
	- **Control symptoms** and exacerbations: low residue, high fiber diet.
### Hiatal Hernia
The protrusion of the **stomach** upwards through the **diaphragmatic hiatus**. This hiatus is part of the muscle that divides the thoracic cavity and the peritoneal cavity. The hiatus is the point where the esophagus connects to the stomach. This may be **congenital** or **acquired**— increased intraabdominal pressure, such as in obesity, pregnancy, and lifting.
1. **Types**:
	- **Sliding Hernia**: the herniation progresses towards the esophagus
	- **Rolling** (Paraesophageal) **Hernia**: the herniation progresses sidewards
	- **Mixed-Type Hernia** (combination of both)
![[hernia_hiatal-types.png]]
2. **Signs and Symptoms**: the most prominent clinical manifestation of a hiatal hernia is **pyrosis** (heartburn) resulting from the compromised lower esophageal sphincter and the heightened intraabdominal pressure. As such, this hernia is one of the etiologies of GERD.
	- **Esophagitis**, **dysphagia** (difficult), and **odynophagia** (pain) are all caused by irritation and injury to the esophageal tract by gastric acid.
	- Chronic irritation of the esophageal epithelium causes its normally squamous cells to undergo metaplasia into columnar cells, which is known as **Barrett's Esophagus**— the most common precancerous condition of the esophagus.
	- **Nursing Diagnosis**: **Pain**
3. **Diagnostic Evaluation**: (a) **esophagoscopy** and (b) **barium swallow** with imaging.
4. **Management**: the main goal is to **==prevent reflux==**:
	- **Keep the patient upright** 1 to 2 hours after eating; do not lie down.
	- **No bedtime snacks**
	- **Elevate the head of bed by 6 inches** to reduce nighttime reflux.
	- Avoid **food and drug that can decrease the lower esophageal sphincter's ability to constrict**: soft drinks, alcohol, fatty foods, chocolate, spices/spiciness, Fosamax, Valium
	- Avoid **activities that increase intraabdominal pressure**: lifting, straining, Valsalva maneuver, bending by the stomach
	- Avoid **constrictive clothing**
	- Use **antacids** 30 to 60 minutes after eating
	- Use **histamine receptor blockers** (H₂ antagonists) such as Ranitidine to decrease acid production
	- The most effective drugs for GERD are **proton pump inhibitors** (Omeprazole, Esomeprazole) to decreased acid production.
	- **Surgery** is the **last consideration**.

>[!EXAMPLE] Inguinal and Femoral Hernia
>1. An **inguinal hernia** is the protrusion of a loop of intestine through the inguinal canal due to weakness or defect in the abdominal muscle.
>2. A **femoral hernia** is the protrusion of a loop of intestine through the femoral canal where the femoral artery and vein also pass through.
>
>These hernias run the risk of **strangulation** where the loop of intestine is constricted and potentially injured. In such a case, herniorrhaphy becomes emergent. Otherwise, surgical correction may be considered as an elective surgery.
### Liver Cirrhosis
Liver Cirrhosis is an **irreversible, progressive scarring** (fibrosis) **of the liver**. This is commonly caused by **alcohol** (Laennec's Cirrhosis), **infection** (hepatitis), **drugs** (hepatotoxicity), **hepatoma** (Liver Cancer), and **idiopathy** (biliary cirrhosis). Specifically for infection and hepatotoxicity, they are considered as **post-necrotic** cirrhosis.

| Signs of Liver Dysfunction                 | Pathophysiology                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Jaundice**, **Decreased Fat Absorption** | Emulsification of fats by **bile** is required for absorption. The liver produces bile out of water, **bilirubin**, cholesterol, and bile salts. In liver dysfunction, bilirubin is not taken up by the liver and **jaundice** occurs as bilirubin levels increase. **Decreased bile production** results in **decreased fat absorption**.                |
| **Weight Loss**, **Weakness**              | The liver is **the site of fat metabolism**— lipogenesis, lipolysis, and gluconeogenesis. In liver dysfunction, **weight loss and weakness** occur as fat is no longer stored or used in the body as energy.                                                                                                                                              |
| **Fatigue**                                | Glycogenesis and glycogenolysis as processes in **carbohydrate metabolism** in the liver become impaired, which results in **easy fatigability** from decreased energy stores (glycogen).                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Bipedal Edema**                          | **Albumin**, the major protein in the blood, is produced in the liver. It maintains intravascular pressure by exerting **oncotic** (attractive) **pressure** to fluids, maintaining circulating volume. When albumin decreases in liver dysfunction, oncotic pressure decreases, and fluid leaves the intravascular space, producing **edema** (bipedal). |
| **Hepatic Encephalopathy**                 | **Protein metabolism** produces **ammonia**, which the liver converts into **urea**, which can be excreted by the urine. If it is unable to do so, **ammonia levels rise**, which result in **hepatic encephalopathy**, a severe complication of liver cirrhosis.                                                                                         |
| **Carbohydrate Metabolism**                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Vitamin Deficiency**                     | Fat-soluble vitamins are absorbed along with fats, which rely on emulsification by bile. If bile is insufficient, the fat-soluble vitamins (ADEK) may become deficient as the body fails to absorb them. Additionally, some B vitamins are also stored in the liver.                                                                                      |
| **Bleeding**                               | **All clotting factors are produced by the liver**. In liver dysfunction, the patient becomes prone to **bleeding problems**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Altered Pharmacokinetics**               | **Biotransformation of drugs** i.e. the metabolism of drugs into inactive metabolites for excretion is primarily done by the liver. In liver dysfunction, these patients experience **altered pharmacokinetics** and normal doses of drugs may cause toxic effects.                                                                                       |

| Signs of Portal Hypertension                                    | Pathophysiology                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Normal physiology of the portal vein →                          | All the blood returning from the gastrointestinal tract passes through the **portal vein**. This blood contains food and drugs and are immediately metabolized in the **liver** before entering circulation through the **hepatic vein** then to the inferior vena cava.                                     |
| **Ascites**                                                     | **Tissue scarring** stiffens the liver, **increasing pressure in the portal vein**. It is in portal hypertension that fluid escapes the intravascular compartment into the peritoneum— **ascites**.                                                                                                          |
| **Neovascularization**— **Hemorrhoids**, **Esophageal Varices** | This also causes blood to back up in gastrointestinal circulation, resulting in **hemorrhoids** (recto-anal varices) and **esophageal varices**, which are fragile and easily rupture; bleeding risks. Combined with impaired production of clotting factors, patients are highly susceptible to hemorrhage. |
| **Vascular Changes**— **Caput Medusae**, **Spider Angiomas**    | Blood from GI circulation escapes through collateral vessels due to portal hypertension, forming **prominent distended abdominal veins** (**caput medusae**) and **spider angiomas** (pathognomonic of liver cirrhosis)                                                                                      |
1. **Diagnostic Examination**: the most definitive test for liver cirrhosis is a **liver biopsy**. In a liver biopsy, the patient is positioned **supine with a pillow under the right upper quadrant**. After the procedure, a common complication is **bleeding**, hence the patient must be positioned **right side-lying with a pillow under the right upper quadrant**. This compresses the biopsy site, reducing bleeding.
	- Additionally, **elevated liver enzymes** (AST, ALT) can show a result of up to three times normal value.
	- **Imaging**: Ultrasound, MRI, CT Scan
2. **Early Stage Management**: *non-specific* symptoms— **weight loss**, **weakness**, **fatigue**, **bipedal edema** (altered metabolism, albumin production). **Nursing Diagnoses**: **Fluid Volume Excess**, **Imbalanced Nutrition, Less Than Body Requirements**, **Fatigue**, **Activity Tolerance**, **Risk for Injury**:
	- Restrict fluids and sodium or use diuretics (potassium-sparing) as ordered.
	- Diet: low sodium, low fat, low cholesterol, high iron (for anemia), high albumin
	- Monitor intake and output, vital signs, and weigh the patient daily
	- Provide rest periods, and ensure safety (for weakness and fatigue)
	- Slow down the progression of the disease: avoid alcohol, follow diet regimen, avoid fatigue, stress, infection, hepatotoxic drugs, and other precipitating factors.
3. **Late Stage Management**: *specific* symptoms also appear in addition to early signs— **ascites**, **dyspnea**, **anorexia**, **jaundice**, **portal hypertension** (hepatomegaly, esophageal varices, rectoanal varices, hemorrhoids, bleeding), **vascular changes** (caput medusae, spider angioma), and **complications** (hepatic encephalopathy, primary peritonitis, hepatorenal syndrome)
	- As earlier, continue restrictions (Fluid, Na) and monitoring (I&O, VS, Wt). However, **protein is now limited**, as this may contribute to hepatic encephalopathy.
	- Rest and safety is still required. Importantly, **avoid bleeding**:
		- Avoid trauma, avoid variceal rupturing (straining, coughing)
		- Use an electric, soft-bristled toothbrush
		- The use of a **Sengstaken-Blakemore Tube**, a three-lumen tube, can apply physical support to esophageal varices with a balloon (second lumen) while maintaining patency with the stomach (first lumen), and anchoring the tube in place (third lumen). While in place, **watch out for airway problems** due to its proximity to the trachea. **In case of anchor rupture**, the pressure of the second lumen pushes the tube upwards and obstructs breathing. The nurse needs to **rupture the tube with a pair of scissors** and remove the tube.
		- **Blood transfusion**: **PRBC** may be required if bleeding is severe. **FFP** and **Cryoprecipitate** may be given to restore clotting factors.
	- **Diet**: restrict sodium, **low protein**, low fat, low cholesterol, high iron (for anemia), high vitamin content (ADEK/B). **Restrict alcohol**.
	- **Position** the patient on **reverse Trendelenburg** to localize ascites away from the diaphragm to relieve breathing.
	- **Paracentesis** may be used if ascites is severe. Patients **empty the bladder** and are **positioned upright** (sitting). A catheter is anchored to just below the umbilicus to serve as an exit point. **Not all fluid is removed at once** to avoid causing hypotension.
	- **Skin care** may be required for pruritic jaundice.
	- **Beta-blockers** may be used to **reduce portal hypertension**.
	- **Manage complications**:
		- Primary peritonitis, treated with massive doses of antibiotics
		- Hepatorenal syndrome: kidney injury
		- Hepatic encephalopathy: a metabolic brain disease characterized by increased ammonia in the blood causing an altered level of consciousness. There are staging classifications:
			- **Stage I**: Confusion, asterixis (flapping tremor)
			- **Stage II**: Lethargy, asterixis
			- **Stage III**: Stuporous, potential loss of asterixis
			- **Stage IV**: Comatose, no asterixis present
	- **Controlling hepatic encephalopathy**: **restrict protein** in the diet, **avoid bleeding** (hemolysis eventually produces ammonia), **decrease putrefaction** that contributes to ammonia formation (remove fecal materials with laxatives/enema or remove gut bacteria with antibiotics)
		- **Maintain privacy**, **prevent immobility complications**, **promote safety**, and **continue communicating** with the patient, even if comatose.

The nurse would expect which of these assessment findings in a client with duodenal ulcers?
1. Epigastric pain occurring at night
2. Distended abdomen
3. Epigastric pain relieved by vomiting
4. Positive fluid wave
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>1. **Epigastric pain at night is found in duodenal ulcers** as gastric emptying continues at night, and irritates the duodenum. Eating at night when pain occurs closes the pylorus, which relieves pain.
>2. A distended abdomen is a complication, but is not expected.
>3. Epigastric pain relieved by vomiting is seen in **gastric ulcers**.
>4. A positive fluid wave is seen in **ascites**.

The client has had a total gastrectomy. The nurse should teach the client about the necessary long-term treatment for which of these conditions?

>Choledocholithiasis is stone formation in the common bile duct. This can result in **obstruction**, and bile is unable to exit, and produces jaundice and pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. After obstruction, the common bile duct can become traversable by bacteria in the small intestine, which is what "*ascending cholangitis*" refers to. This infection incites a fever, completing **Charcot's Triad of Ascending Cholangitis**: jaundice, RUQ pain, and fever.

After pyloroplasty, which of the following interventions prevent rapid gastric emptying?
1. Simple sugar in the diet
2. Low protein intake
3. Liquid must be taken in between meals
4. All of the above
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>3
>
>A pyloroplasty repairs the pylorus by widening the pyloric sphincter. This puts the client at risk for dumping syndrome, which is promoted by **simple sugars** or carbohydrates in general (eliminate Option 1). **Fluids** also promote gastric emptying, which contribute to the pathophysiology of dumping syndrome.
>
>In patients with dumping syndrome, the following diet is followed:
>1. Low carbohydrates; restrict simple sugars
>2. High protein, which aids in preventing fluid shifting (prevent diarrhea)
>3. Moderate fat content to promote slow gastric emptying

A client with possible appendicitis is being assessed. Which of the following is not contraindicated in this client?
1. Cleansing enema
2. Digital rectal examination
3. Warm compress
4. None of the above
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>2
>
>A digital rectal exam does not reach deep enough to affect the appendix, and is therefore not contraindicated. Any enema will put the patient with appendicitis at risk for **rupture**. Warm compresses, which promote vasodilation and therefore **increases swelling**, also increases the risk for rupture. Additionally, laxatives also promote rupturing.
