# Digestive System
The digestive system consists of a long tube also known as the **alimentary canal** where ingested substances travel and undergo mechanical and chemical digestion for conversion into absorbable units of food for **nutrition**. In conjunction with this canal, **accessory organs of digestion** (liver, gallbladder, salivary glands, pancreas) aid in the digestion of food.

>[!TIP] GIT Subdivisions and Function
>The **Upper GIT**, starting from the mouth to the small intestine, is where **digestion** primarily takes place.
>
>The **Lower GIT**, starting from the large intestine to the anus, involves:
>1. **Absorption**; the reabsorption of water that converts stool into its formed, solid state.
>2. **Synthesis of Vitamin K** by the normal gut flora *E. coli*, which makes up roughly 50% of an individual's Vitamin K. This is **necessary for the production of clotting factors X, IX, VII, and II** (Vitamin K dependent clotting factors). This is the mechanism behind the importance of Vitamin K in stopping bleeding.
>3. **Putrifaction** also occurs, where *E. coli* interacts with fecal materials to produce flatus, a combination of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane, and ammonia

>[!ERROR] GI Bleeding
>**Gastrointestinal bleeding** can occur along any part of the alimentary canal. In general, this is also divided between **Upper GI Bleeding** (UGIB) and **Lower GI Bleeding** (LGIB), which present differently:
>1. **UGIB** gives time for the blood to be acted upon by digestive enzymes and the acids of the body. This converts its color into a dark, tarry form that produces **melenic stool** (melena); stool that is dark, tarry, and foul-smelling, one characteristic of upper GI bleeding.
>2. **LGIB** occurs in the non-digestive part of the alimentary canal, which allows blood to retain its original color upon being excreted along with stool. This appears as **hematochezia**; stool that is red and bloody.

## Abdominal Assessment
Compared to the normal sequence of assessment (IPPA), abdominal assessment follows **IAPePa**: **inspection**, **auscultation**, **percussion**, and **palpation**. This sequence prioritizes auscultation as percussion and palpation can alter bowel sounds when performed, modifying assessment findings.
1. **Inspection**: view the skin for its color, common discoloration signs (Grey-Turner, Cullen's), masses, distention, and contour
2. **Auscultation**: listening for bowel sounds in all quadrants for one full minute, normally occurring from 5 to 35 sounds in 60 seconds. Bowel sounds often change in conditions that involve abdominal cramping, diarrhea, or obstructions.
3. **Percussion**
4. **Palpation**

The abdominal areas may be subdivided into four quadrants or nine regions:
1. **Nine-Region System**: this system divides the abdomen into nine areas using two horizontal and two vertical lines (midclavicular lines). The lowest region ends at the level of the highest part of the pelvic bone (transtubercular line), and the highest region ends at the end of the ribcage (subcostal line).

| Left                  | Middle                   | Right                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Left Hypochondriac    | Epigastric               | Right Hypochondriac    |
| Left Lumbar           | Umbilical                | Right Lumbar           |
| Left Iliac (Inguinal) | Hypogastric (Suprapubic) | Right Iliac (Inguinal) |
2. **Four-Quadrant System**: this system divides the abdomen into four with the midline from the xiphoid to the symphysis pubis, and a transverse cut across the umbilicus.

>[!TIP] Nausea and Vomiting
>The part of the brain that produces vomiting when stimulated is the **chemoreceptor trigger zone** (CTZ). Any stimulation of this zone results in vomiting. Some of these stimuli include:
>- Any inflammation in the abdominal region
>- Any obstruction in the abdominal region
>- Increased intracranial pressure
>- Vertigo or dizziness
>- Anticancer drugs
>- Early pregnancy
>- Sensory exposure to gross or noxious elements
## Inflammatory Disorders
**Inflammatory diseases** share common presentations, and are those disorders that end in "-*itis*". The primary manifestations of inflammatory disorders include (a) **pain**, (b) **nausea and vomiting**, and (c) **indigestion** (dyspepsia).

1. **Gastritis**
2. **Peptic Ulcer Disease** (PUD); A.K.A. **Erosive Inflammation**
3. **Inflammatory Bowel Diseases** (IBD):
	1. **Regional Enteritis**; A.K.A. **Chron's Disease**
	2. **Ulcerative Colitis**
4. **Appendicitis**
5. **Diverticulitis**
6. **Cholecystitis**
7. **Pancreatitis**

>[!ERROR] Pain Location & Associated Disorders
>
>|Location|Disorders|
>|---|---|
>|**LUQ**|Pancreatitis|
>|**LLQ**|Ulcerative colitis, Diverticulitis|
>|**RUQ**|Cholecystitis|
>|**RLQ**|Crohn's Disease, Appendicitis|
>|**Epigastric Region**| Gastritis, Peptic Ulcer Disease|
## Non-inflammatory Disorders
1. **Irritable Bowel Syndrome** (IBS): a **functional** (no causative structural defects) disorder with an unknown cause— an **idiopathic** disorder. However, this has been theorized to be caused by neural or hormonal defects in gastrointestinal regulation.
	- **Risk Factors**: stress, family history
	- **Signs and Symptoms**: IBS is classified as **IBS-c** (results in **constipation**), **IBS-d** (results in **mucoid diarrhea**), or IBS-m/**IBS-a** (results in **mixed** or **alternating diarrhea and constipation**). Additionally the following also occur:
		- **Indigestion** (dyspepsia)
		- **Abdominal pain**
	- **Diagnostic Evaluation**: mainly *exclusionary*, as there is no test specific to IBS. These include **colonoscopy**, **CBC**, **ESR** (elevated in inflammation), **imaging** (UTZ)
	- **Management** is **==palliative==**; symptom-based:
		- **Diarrhea**: high protein (prevent fluid shifting), low residue, high fiber and fluid diet with **fluid replacement** (Oresol). In severe cases, **antidiarrheals** (Loperamide) may be given.
		- **Constipation**: low fat, high fiber diet with increased fluid intake. In severe cases, **laxatives** may be prescribed.
		- **Control symptoms** and exacerbations: low residue, high fiber diet.
2. **Hiatal Hernia**: the protrusion of the **stomach** upwards through the **diaphragmatic hiatus**. This hiatus is part of the muscle that divides the thoracic cavity and the peritoneal cavity. The hiatus is the point where the esophagus connects to the stomach. This may be **congenital** or **acquired**— increased intraabdominal pressure, such as in obesity, pregnancy, and lifting.
	- **Types**:
		- **Sliding Hernia**: the herniation progresses towards the esophagus
		- **Rolling** (Paraesophageal) **Hernia**: the herniation progresses sidewards
		- **Mixed-Type Hernia** (combination of both)
	![[hernia_hiatal-types.png]]
	- **Signs and Symptoms**: the most prominent clinical manifestation of a hiatal hernia is **pyrosis** (heartburn) resulting from the compromised lower esophageal sphincter and the heightened intraabdominal pressure. As such, this hernia is one of the etiologies of GERD.
		- **Esophagitis**, **dysphagia** (difficult), and **odynophagia** (pain) are all caused by irritation and injury to the esophageal tract by gastric acid.
		- Chronic irritation of the esophageal epithelium causes its normally squamous cells to undergo metaplasia into columnar cells, which is known as **Barrett's Esophagus**— the most common precancerous condition of the esophagus.
		- **Nursing Diagnosis**: **Pain**
	- **Diagnostic Evaluation**: (a) **esophagoscopy** and (b) **barium swallow** with imaging.
	- **Management**: the main goal is to **==prevent reflux==**:
		- **Keep the patient upright** 1 to 2 hours after eating; do not lie down.
		- **No bedtime snacks**
		- **Elevate the head of bed by 6 inches** to reduce nighttime reflux.
		- Avoid **food and drug that can decrease the lower esophageal sphincter's ability to constrict**: soft drinks, alcohol, fatty foods, chocolate, spices/spiciness, Fosamax, Valium
		- Avoid **activities that increase intraabdominal pressure**: lifting, straining, Valsalva maneuver, bending by the stomach
		- Avoid **constrictive clothing**
		- Use **antacids** 30 to 60 minutes after eating
		- Use **histamine receptor blockers** (H₂ antagonists) such as Ranitidine to decrease acid production
		- The most effective drugs for GERD are **proton pump inhibitors** (Omeprazole, Esomeprazole) to decreased acid production.
		- **Surgery** is the **last consideration**.

>[!EXAMPLE] Inguinal and Femoral Hernia
>1. An **inguinal hernia** is the protrusion of a loop of intestine through the inguinal canal due to weakness or defect in the abdominal muscle.
>2. A **femoral hernia** is the protrusion of a loop of intestine through the femoral canal where the femoral artery and vein also pass through.
>
>These hernias run the risk of **strangulation** where the loop of intestine is constricted and potentially injured. In such a case, herniorrhaphy becomes emergent. Otherwise, surgical correction may be considered as an elective surgery.

3. **Liver Cirrhosis**: an irreversible, progressive scarring (fibrosis) of the liver. This is commonly caused by **alcohol** (Laennec's Cirrhosis), **infection** (hepatitis), **drugs** (hepatotoxicity), **hepatoma** (Liver Cancer), and **idiopathy** (biliary cirrhosis).
	- Specifically for infection and hepatotoxicity, they are considered as **post-necrotic** cirrhosis.
	- **Pathophysiology**: (a) **liver dysfunction** and (b) **portal hypertension**
		- **Liver dysfunction** affects:
			1. **Bile production**: emulsification of fats by bile for absorption. Bile contains water, bilirubin, cholesterol, and bile salts. In liver dysfunction, bilirubin is not taken up by the liver, and **jaundice** occurs. Decreased bile production results in **decreased fat absorption**.
			2. **Fat Metabolism**: the liver is the site of fat metabolism— lipogenesis, lipolysis, and gluconeogenesis. In liver dysfunction, **weight loss and weakness** occur as fat is no longer stored or used in the body as energy.
			3. **Carbohydrate Metabolism**: glycogenesis and glycogenolysis in the liver become impaired, which results in **easy fatigability**.
			4. **Protein Metabolism**: albumin, the major protein in the blood, is produced in the liver. It maintains intravascular pressure by exerting oncotic (attractive) pressure to fluids, increasing volume. When albumin decreases in liver disease, oncotic pressure decreases, and fluid leaves the intravascular space, producing **edema**. Additionally, the liver converts ammonia to urea for excretion. In liver dysfunction, ammonia increases in the blood, which can result in **hepatic encephalopathy**.
			5. **Clotting Factors**: all clotting factors are produced by the liver. In liver dysfunction, the patient becomes prone to **bleeding problems**.
			6. **Fat-Soluble Vitamins** and some Vitamin B are stored in the liver.
			7. **Biotransformation of Drugs** i.e. metabolism of drugs into inactive metabolites for excretion. In liver cirrhosis, these patients experience altered pharmacokinetics and normal doses of drugs may cause toxic effects.
		- **Portal hypertension**:
			- All the blood returning from the gastrointestinal tract passes through the **portal vein**. This blood contains food and drugs and are immediately metabolized in the **liver** before entering circulation through the **hepatic vein** then to the inferior vena cava.
			- **Tissue scarring** stiffens the liver, **increasing pressure in the portal vein**. It is in portal hypertension that fluid escapes the intravascular compartment into the peritoneum— **ascites**. 
			- This also causes blood to back up in gastrointestinal circulation, resulting in **hemorrhoids** (recto-anal varices) and **esophageal varices**, which are fragile and easily rupture; bleeding risks. Combined with impaired production of clotting factors, patients are highly susceptible to hemorrhage.
			- Blood from GI circulation escapes through collateral vessels due to portal hypertension, forming **prominent distended abdominal veins** (**caput medusae**) and **spider angiomas** (pathognomonic of liver cirrhosis)
	- **Diagnostic Examination**: the most definitive test for liver cirrhosis is a **liver biopsy**. In a liver biopsy, the patient is positioned **supine with a pillow under the right upper quadrant**. After the procedure, a common complication is **bleeding**, hence the patient must be positioned **right side-lying with a pillow under the right upper quadrant**. This compresses the biopsy site, reducing bleeding.
		- Additionally, **elevated liver enzymes** (AST, ALT) can show a result of up to three times normal value.
		- **Imaging**: Ultrasound, MRI, CT Scan
	- **Management** is symptomatic:

# Sample Questions
## Gastrointestinal System
Which of the following instructions is **appropriate** for a nurse to give to a patient who has gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)?
1. Take prescribed antacids before eating
2. Place blocks under the legs of the head of the bed
3. Eat a high-fat, low-protein diet
4. Lie down for one hour after eating
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>The nurse attempts to prevent the occurrence of reflux and heartburn.
>1. Antacids are given after meals, usually 30 to 60 minutes post cebum in order to give time for gastric secretions to be released before administering the antacid to neutralize them.
>2. **The use of a reverse Trendelenburg position uses gravity to reduce the occurrence of reflux**.
>3. A high-fat diet will enhance gastric acid production.
>4. Lying down after eating will allow gastric contents to flow upwards, worsening heartburn.

A nurse would assess a patient who has undergone a total gastrectomy for **early** symptoms of dumping syndrome, which include which of the following?
1. Diaphoresis and lightheadedness
2. Facial flushing and paresthesia
3. Disorientation and vomiting
4. Diarrhea and abdominal distention
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>1
>
>A total gastrectomy will predispose the patient to dumping syndrome, wherein gastric contents rapidly empty into the intestine. The presence of glucose in the gastric contents draw water into the intestines to produce diarrhea. However, option 4 contains abdominal distention, which is not included. The water drawn into the intestines reduces total blood volume, which results in **diaphoresis and lightheadedness**.

Which of the following statements, if made by a patient who has diverticulitis, would indicate to a nurse that the patient is following the diet plan correctly?
1. I eat meat five times a week 
2. I do not eat fried foods
3. I drink decaffeinated coffee
4. I eat green salad every day
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>4
>
>Diverticulosis is a condition characterized by the formation of diverticula in the colon, small outpouching of the colon. This is normally asymptomatic, but can result in diverticulitis once the pouches become inflamed.
>
>**Option 4** tackles the risk factor of **constipation** implicated in the development of diverticula.

A nurse should expect a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube to be ordered for a patient who has bleeding esophageal varices in order to:
1. Cause vasoconstriction of the splenic artery
2. Ensure airway potency
3. Provide for enteral nutrition
4. Apply direct pressure to the area
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>4
>
>A Sengstaken-Blakemore tube is a triple-lumen tube that is inserted into the esophagus to **compress the blood vessels to prevent bleeding**.

Which of the following factors, if noted in a patient's history, would indicate a predisposition for developing cholecystitis?
1. Obesity
2. Hypertension
3. Depression
4. Childlessness
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>1
>
>Cholecystitis is an inflammation of the gallbladder. Its main risk factors are the presence of gallstones (cholelithiasis). For cholelithiasis, the four main risk factors (4 Fs) include being **female**, **fat**, **forty** and above, and/or **fertile**.

A client with cirrhosis may have alterations in which of the following laboratory values?
1. Carbon dioxide level
2. ALT
3. pH
4. Erythropoietin
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>1. CO<sub>2</sub> is implicated in lung problems.
>2. **ALT is a liver enzyme**, which becomes elevated in liver injury.
>3. pH can be affected by many systems, mainly the lungs and kidneys.
>4. Erythropoietin is produced by the kidneys.

A client with acute pancreatitis asks the nurse, "When will I be able to eat again?" The most appropriate response by the nurse is
1. "If you do not have the infection in the pancreas anymore."
2. "When the doctors order for it."
3. "When your blood test for enzymes improves."
4. "Maybe after a week."
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>3
>
>Acute pancreatitis is diagnosed by increasing pancreatic enzyme levels. This includes lipases (more destructive) and amylase. Conversely, the reduction of these enzymes indicate the resolution of disease and signal tolerance for the original diet (**Option 3**)

The nurse would expect which of these assessment findings in a client with duodenal ulcers?
1. Epigastric pain occurring at night
2. Distended abdomen
3. Epigastric pain relieved by vomiting
4. Positive fluid wave
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>1. **Epigastric pain at night is found in duodenal ulcers** as gastric emptying continues at night, and irritates the duodenum. Eating at night when pain occurs closes the pylorus, which relieves pain.
>2. A distended abdomen is a complication, but is not expected.
>3. Epigastric pain relieved by vomiting is seen in **gastric ulcers**.
>4. A positive fluid wave is seen in **ascites**.

The client has had a total gastrectomy. The nurse should teach the client about the necessary long-term treatment for which of these conditions?
1. Vitamin K deficiency
2. Vitamin A deficiency
3. Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency
4. Vitamin C deficiency
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>3
>
>The removal of the entire stomach, especially its lower end, removes the parietal cells that produce **intrinsic factor**, a vital substance in the absorption of **Vitamin B<sub>12</sub>**. This results in Vit. B<sub>12</sub> deficiency that can cause **pernicious anemia**.

In caring for a client with hiatal hernia, which of the following should be included in a teaching plan regarding the causes?
1. Avoid heavy lifting
2. Dietary plan based on soft foods
3. Prevalence in young adults
4. Prevalence in fair-skinned individuals
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>1
>
>Hiatal herniation occurs due to **increased intraabdominal pressure**, which pushes the stomach upwards, causing gastroesophageal reflux and pain. **Heavy lifting** requires bracing the core of the body, increasing intraabdominal pressure.

The most fatal complication of choledocholithiasis is ascending cholangitis which may complicate to develop what type of shock?
1. Hypovolemic Shock
2. Septic Shock
3. Anaphylactic Shock 
4. Neurogenic Shock
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>2
>
>Choledocholithiasis is stone formation in the common bile duct. This can result in **obstruction**, and bile is unable to exit, and produces jaundice and pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. After obstruction, the common bile duct can become traversable by bacteria in the small intestine, which is what "*ascending cholangitis*" refers to. This infection incites a fever, completing **Charcot's Triad of Ascending Cholangitis**: jaundice, RUQ pain, and fever.
>
>All in all, this puts the patient at risk for **septic shock** once the patient displays **Charcot's triad**, **hypotension**, and **confusion**. All together, this is known as **Reynold's Pentad**.

A client with liver cirrhosis has severe ascites and is experiencing difficulty of breathing. Which of the following is the priority nursing intervention?
1. Prepare for paracentesis
2. Administer diuretics as ordered
3. Place the client in a reverse Trendelenburg position
4. All of the above
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>3
>
>Difficulty of breathing in a patient is caused by **pressure on the diaphragm** from the collection of fluid in the peritoneum. The priority action to take is to utilize a **reverse Trendelenburg position** to localize the fluid to the bottom of the peritoneum.

After pyloroplasty, which of the following interventions prevent rapid gastric emptying?
1. Simple sugar in the diet
2. Low protein intake
3. Liquid must be taken in between meals
4. All of the above
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>3
>
>A pyloroplasty repairs the pylorus by widening the pyloric sphincter. This puts the client at risk for dumping syndrome, which is promoted by **simple sugars** or carbohydrates in general (eliminate Option 1). **Fluids** also promote gastric emptying, which contribute to the pathophysiology of dumping syndrome.
>
>In patients with dumping syndrome, the following diet is followed:
>1. Low carbohydrates; restrict simple sugars
>2. High protein, which aids in preventing fluid shifting (prevent diarrhea)
>3. Moderate fat content to promote slow gastric emptying

A client with possible appendicitis is being assessed. Which of the following is not contraindicated in this client?
1. Cleansing enema
2. Digital rectal examination
3. Warm compress
4. None of the above
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>2
>
>A digital rectal exam does not reach deep enough to affect the appendix, and is therefore not contraindicated. Any enema will put the patient with appendicitis at risk for **rupture**. Warm compresses, which promote vasodilation and therefore **increases swelling**, also increases the risk for rupture. Additionally, laxatives also promote rupturing.

The "I" in "IBS" refers to which word?
1. Irritable
2. Inflammatory
3. Infectious
4. Incredible
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>1. IBS stands for **Irritable Bowel Syndrome**.

A clinic nurse is providing health teaching for a patient with newly diagnosed gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Which of the following is an inappropriate teaching to provide to the patient?
1. Change dietary patterns to small frequent feedings with a bedtime snack
2. Avoid wearing tight clothing
3. Use magnesium carbonate (Gaviscon) to neutralize acidity
4. Avoid bending, stopping, or slumping postures
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>1
>
>While small frequent feedings is correct, a **bedtime snack** is not suggested as this stimulates digestive processes at bedtime, which predisposes the patient lying down to experience heartburn.

Postoperatively, the patient develops dumping syndrome. Which of the following statements, if made by the patient, should indicate the need for further dietary teaching?
1. "I should eat bread with each meal."
2. "I should eat smaller meals more frequently."
3. "I should lie down after eating."
4. "I should avoid drinking fluids with my meals."
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>1
>
>Dumping syndrome is enhanced by **carbohydrates** as these stimulate rapid gastric emptying. Therefore, option 1 is incorrect. The patient should eat smaller meals, lie down after eating (to reduce the effect of gravity on gastric emptying), and avoid fluids with meals.

A client with peptic ulcer in the duodenum would probably describe the associated pain as:
1. An ache radiating to their left side
2. An intermittent colicky flank pain
3. A gnawing sensation relieved by food
4. A generalized abdominal pain intensified by moving
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>3
>
>The pain produced by a duodenal ulcer is epigastric in location; not radiating, flank, or generalized. Additionally, eating food closes the pylorus, which relieves irritation of the duodenum.

A nurse is providing instructions to a client about measures to minimize the risk of dumping syndrome. The nurse tells the client to do which of the following?
1. Increase fluid intake, particularly at mealtime
2. Maintain a high-carbohydrate diet
3. Maintain a low-Fowler's position while eating
4. Ambulate for at least 30 minutes after each meal
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>3
>
>Options 1, 2 and 4 all enhance gastric emptying. A low-Fowler's position reduces the effects of gravity on gastric emptying, reducing the severity of dumping syndrome.

A client being treated for esophageal varices has a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube inserted to control the bleeding. The most important assessment is for the nurse to:
1. Check that a hemostat is at the bedside
2. Monitor IV fluids for the shift
3. Regularly assess respiratory status
4. Check that the balloon is deflated on a regular basis
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>3
>
>The nurse prioritizes the **airway** (refer to the ABCs of Life), especially in the context of a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube as the esophagus runs parallel posterior to the trachea.
