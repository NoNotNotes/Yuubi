# Preface
**Acid-base balance** is a content area that most students find complex and difficult to understand. The National Council Licensure Examination, NCLEX, will not ask specific questions about the pathophysiology associated with acid-base disorders, such as the hydrogen ions, acids, bases, and the regulatory systems for hydrogen ion concentration in the blood. However, you still need to understand pathophysiology. So for content related to pathophysiology, I direct you to Saunders' comprehensive review for the NCLEX examination for a self-paced review. As you review, there are five strategic points related to regulatory systems to keep in mind. These include the following. One, when you hear or read the words hydrogen ions, think acids. Two, when you hear or read the words base or bicarbonate, think alkaline.

00:59
In acidosis, although hypoventilation may occur initially, the respiratory rate and depth increase in an attempt to exhale acids. Four, in alkalosis, although hyperventilation may occur initially, the respiratory rate and depth decrease. Carbon dioxide is retained to neutralize and decrease the strength of excess bicarbonate. Five, when the client experiences an acid-base imbalance, potassium moves in or out of the

01:29
in an attempt to maintain acid-base balance. In acidosis, hydrogen ions move into the cell and potassium moves out of the cell. Therefore, the serum potassium level increases. In alkalosis, the opposite movement occurs. Hydrogen ions move out of the cell and potassium moves into the cell. Therefore, the serum potassium level decreases. For the NCLEX, there are four disorders that you need to focus on. These include 1.

01:59
respiratory acidosis, two, respiratory alkalosis, three, metabolic acidosis, and four, metabolic alkalosis. What will you be asked about on NCLEX? You will be asked about the causes of each disorder, clinical manifestations, and treatment. We will review each acid-based disorder, but first, let me provide you with a strategy for answering these types of questions.

02:26
If you are asked to determine which acid-base disorder is expected to occur in a specific condition, note the condition identified in the test question. If the condition is a respiratory one, then the answer is going to be a respiratory acid-base disorder. If the condition identified in the test question is not a respiratory one, then the answer will be a metabolic acid-base disorder. For example, the test question reads

02:53
The nurse caring for a client with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, known as COPD, monitors for which acid-based disorder that is most likely to occur. Your options are 1. Respiratory acidosis 2. Respiratory alkalosis 3. Metabolic acidosis and 4. Metabolic alkalosis. Since the question identifies a respiratory condition, you can easily eliminate options 3 and 4, the metabolic conditions.

03:23
You are 50% closer to answering the question correctly. Now, how do you select correctly from the remaining two options? Note the respiratory condition presented in the question and think about its pathophysiology. If the disorder causes an obstruction of the airways or depresses the respiratory system, then the answer is respiratory acidosis. If the disorder causes overstimulation of the respiratory system, then the answer is respiratory alkalosis.

03:51
This sample question identifies a client with COPD. And remember that a client with COPD loses elasticity of alveolar sacs, restricting airflow. These clients and those with emphysema, bronchiectasis, or bronchitis, develop inflammation causing airway obstruction. Therefore, the answer to this sample question is respiratory acidosis. Now, what other conditions cause respiratory acidosis? One, asthma.

04:19
Remember, bronchial spasm leads to airway constriction. Two, pneumonia or atelectasis, because excess mucus production leads to airway obstruction. Three, pulmonary edema, because excess accumulation of fluid leads to airway obstruction, and pulmonary emboli, because the emboli cause airway obstruction. Four, any central nervous system depressant, such as sedatives, opioids, or anesthetics, can lead to respiratory acidosis.

04:49
because these depressants cause hypoventilation. Five, and finally, brain trauma, because brain trauma causes pressure on the respiratory center or medulla and depresses respirations. Now, let's review another sample question. The nurse would monitor a client who is being mechanically ventilated for which acid-based disorder that is caused by overventilation. Your options are, one, respiratory acidosis, two, respiratory alkalosis,

05:18
3. Metabolic Acidosis and 4. Metabolic Alkalosis. Since the question identifies a respiratory condition, you can easily eliminate options 3 and 4, the metabolic conditions. So, you are 50% closer to answering the question correctly. Now, how do you select correctly from the remaining two? Note the condition presented in the question. This sample question identifies a client who is overventilated. Therefore, the answer is

05:46
respiratory alkalosis. Now, what other conditions cause respiratory alkalosis? One, fever, because it increases metabolism, resulting in overstimulation of the respiratory system. Two, hyperventilation or rapid respirations results in overstimulation of the respiratory system. Three, hypoxic conditions will stimulate the respiratory center in the brainstem, causing hyperventilation. Four,

06:14
hysteria, because it results in vigorous, fast breathing, and five, pain, because it leads to overstimulation of the respiratory center in the brainstem. So, to summarize what we reviewed about respiratory disorders. If the client has a condition that causes an obstruction of the airway or depresses the respiratory system, the client is at risk for respiratory acidosis. If the client has a condition that causes overstimulation of the respiratory system,

06:42
the client is at risk for respiratory alkalosis. Now, what about the metabolic acid-base disorders? Metabolic acidosis results from an increased amount of hydrogen ions or acids in the blood, or a decrease in available base or bicarbonate solution. Metabolic alkalosis results from an increased amount of available base or bicarbonate solution in the blood, or a decrease in available hydrogen ions or acids. Again.

07:10
Note the condition identified in the test question. If the condition identified in the question is not a respiratory one, then the answer will be a metabolic acid-base disorder. Let's review this sample test question. The nurse is caring for a client with gastroenteritis who is experiencing severe diarrhea. Which acid-base disorder is most likely to occur in the client? Your options are, one, respiratory acidosis, two,

07:39
respiratory alkalosis, three, metabolic acidosis, and four, metabolic alkalosis. Since the question does not identify a respiratory condition, you can easily eliminate options one and two, the respiratory conditions. So you are 50% closer to answering the question correctly. Now, how do you select correctly from the remaining two options? Note the situation presented in the question and think about what is happening to the client.

08:09
In this situation, excess intestinal contents are being eliminated from the client's body, and intestinal contents are highly alkaline. Therefore, since base or alkaline substances are being removed, the client is at risk for metabolic acidosis. Now, what other conditions cause metabolic acidosis? 1. One primary cause of metabolic acidosis is diabetic ketoacidosis.

08:35
and it is likely that you will be asked about this disorder on NCLEX. In this condition, the insufficient supply of insulin leads to an excess accumulation of ketones or other acids. The bicarbonate then ends up being depleted. Another cause is an excessive ingestion of acetylsalicylic acid, aspirin, which increases the hydrogen ion concentration. A high-fat diet causes a rapid accumulation of the waste products of

09:06
leading to a buildup of ketones and acids. Four, the insufficient metabolism of carbohydrates causes the production of lactic acid, resulting in lactic acidosis. Five, the improper metabolism of nutrients that occurs in the client with malnutrition causes fat catabolism, leading to an excess buildup of ketones and acids. Six, renal insufficiency or renal failure causes the retention of waste products.

09:35
and bicarbonate is unable to maintain acid-base balance. And seven, severe diarrhea. Intestinal and pancreatic secretions are normally alkaline. Therefore, this excessive loss of base leads to acidosis. Now, let's review another sample test question. The test question reads, the nurse is caring for a client with a nasogastric tube attached to continuous suction. The nurse should monitor for which acid-base disorder

10:04
that is most likely to occur. Your options are, one, respiratory acidosis, two, respiratory alkalosis, three, metabolic acidosis, and four, metabolic alkalosis. Since the question does not identify a respiratory condition, you can easily eliminate options one and two, the respiratory conditions. So you are 50% closer to answering the question correctly. Now, how do you select correctly from the remaining two options?

10:35
Note the situation presented in the question and think about what is happening to the client. In this situation, gastric contents are being suctioned out of the client's body, and along with the gastric contents are gastric acids. Therefore, since acids are being removed, the client is at risk for metabolic alkalosis. Remember that metabolic alkalosis results from an increased amount of available base or bicarbonate solution in the blood.

11:03
or a decrease in available acids in the blood. Now, what other conditions cause metabolic alkalosis? One, excessive vomiting, because it leads to an excessive loss of gastric acid. Two, diuretics, because their use results in a loss of hydrogen ions and an accumulation of bicarbonate in the blood. Three, the ingestion of and or infusion of excess sodium bicarbonate, which causes an increase in the amount of base in the blood.

11:33
4. Hyperaldosteronism, which increases renal tubular reabsorption of sodium, resulting in a loss of hydrogen ions or acids. 5. And finally, the client receiving massive transfusions of whole blood because the citrate anticoagulant used for the storage of blood is metabolized to bicarbonate. So, to summarize what we reviewed about metabolic disorders.

11:58
If the client has a condition that will result in an increased amount of hydrogen ions or acids in the blood, or a decrease in available base or bicarbonate solution, the client is at risk for metabolic acidosis. If the client has a condition that will result in an increased amount of available base or bicarbonate solution in the blood, or a decrease in available hydrogen ions or acids, the client is at risk for metabolic alkalosis.

12:27
Let's review the clinical manifestations for the acid-based disorders and treatments. For respiratory and metabolic acidosis disorders, manifestations are similar. For example, with the neurological system, manifestations such as drowsiness, disorientation, confusion, headache, and coma can occur. For the cardiovascular system, blood pressure decreases, dysrhythmias occur, and the skin becomes warm and flushed because of vasodilation.

12:57
For the respiratory system, although hypoventilation may occur initially, the respiratory rate and depth will increase in an attempt to exhale acids. For respiratory and metabolic alkalosis disorders, manifestations are also similar. For example, with the neurological system, manifestations such as drowsiness, dizziness, and confusion can occur. For the cardiovascular system, tachycardia and dysrhythmias occur.

13:26
Gastrointestinal manifestations such as anorexia, nausea, and vomiting can occur. For the respiratory system, although hyperventilation may occur initially, the respiratory rate and depth decrease. Carbon dioxide is then retained to neutralize and decrease the strength of excess bicarbonate. Now let's talk about treatment. Remember that there are some general treatment measures that apply to all types of acid-based disorders.

13:54
These include interventions such as monitoring airway patency, respirations and other vital signs and laboratory results. Next, remember that treatment is also based on the cause of the disorder. For example, if the client is experiencing airway obstruction from accumulated secretions and is experiencing respiratory acidosis, then respiratory treatments will be instituted to loosen and remove these secretions to alleviate the obstruction.

14:22
If the client is experiencing respiratory alkalosis because of a fever, then treatments will be instituted to reduce the fever. If vomiting is the cause of metabolic alkalosis, then measures will be instituted to treat the vomiting. If the cause of metabolic acidosis is diabetic ketoacidosis, then intravenous normal saline and regular insulin will be initiated. So, to summarize what we reviewed about clinical manifestations and treatments. 1.

14:51
Although hypoventilation may occur initially, the respiratory rate and depth increase in an attempt to exhale acids. 2. In alkalosis, although hyperventilation may occur initially, the respiratory rate and depth decrease. Carbon dioxide is then retained to neutralize and decrease the strength of excess bicarbonate. 3. The cause of the disorder is the focus for treatment.

15:20
Finally, NCLEX may test your ability to analyze an arterial blood gas result. Let's review some strategic pyramid points and pyramid steps. If you remember these points and use these steps, you will be able to analyze any blood gas report. Normal arterial blood gas values are pH 7.35 to 7.45, partial pressure of carbon dioxide

15:48
35 to 45 millimeters of mercury, HCO3 or the bicarbonate, 22 to 27 milli-equivalents per liter, partial pressure of oxygen, PO2, 80 to 100 millimeters of mercury. Your pyramid points are, in acidosis, the pH is decreased. In alkalosis, the pH is elevated. Your pyramid steps are,

16:17
Pyramid Step 1. Look at the pH. Is the pH elevated or decreased? If the pH is elevated, it reflects alkalosis. If the pH is decreased, it reflects acidosis. Pyramid Step 2. Look at the PCO2. Is the PCO2 elevated or decreased? If the PCO2 reflects an opposite relationship to the pH, then you know that the condition is a respiratory imbalance.

16:46
If the PCO2 does not reflect an opposite relationship to the pH, then move on to Pyramid Step 3. Pyramid Step 3. Look at the HCO3. Does the HCO3 reflect a corresponding relationship with the pH? If it does, then the condition is a metabolic imbalance. Pyramid Step 4. Remember, compensation has occurred if the pH is in a normal range of 7.35 to 7.45.

17:16
Now, let's practice. Arterial blood gas values are pH of 7.30, PCO2 of 50 millimeters of mercury, HCO3 of 27 milliequivalents per liter, PO2 of 85 millimeters of mercury. First, look at the pH. Is the pH elevated or decreased? The pH of 7.30 is decreased. Therefore, it reflects acidosis. Next,

17:45
Look at the PCO2. Is the PCO2 elevated or decreased? The PCO2 of 50 millimeters of mercury reflects an opposite relationship to the pH, so you know that the condition is a respiratory imbalance. Therefore, this condition is respiratory acidosis. Finally, note that the pH of 7.30 is not within the normal range. Therefore, the condition is uncompensated.

18:12
So, these blood gas values identify respiratory acidosis uncompensated. Let's practice one more. Arterial blood gas values are pH of 7.50, pCO2 of 50 millimeters of mercury, HCO3 of 30 milliequivalents per liter, pO2 of 90 millimeters of mercury. First, look at the pH. Is the pH elevated or decreased? The pH of 7.50 is elevated.

18:41
Therefore, it reflects alkalosis. Next, look at the PCO2. Is the PCO2 elevated or decreased? The PCO2 of 50 millimeters of mercury is elevated and reflects the same relationship to the pH. So you know that the condition is not a respiratory imbalance. Look at the HCO3 and note that it is elevated at 30 milli-equivalents per liter and therefore reflects a corresponding relationship with the pH.

19:11
Thus, the condition is a metabolic imbalance. This condition is metabolic alkalosis. Finally, note that the pH is not within the normal range. Therefore, the condition is uncompensated. So these blood gas values identify metabolic alkalosis uncompensated. This ends the acid-base balance review. I encourage you to continue playing and listening to this audio review and to review the Saunders Comprehensive Review for the NCLEX examination.

19:41
This chapter provides you with additional information about acid-base disorders and practice questions. The Evolve exam review site accompanying the Saunders Comprehensive Review for the NCLEX examination will also provide you with these types of questions if you select Fundamental Skills Fluids and Electrolytes acid-base in the Evolve exam review site content area. I wish you the best of luck on your nursing exams and on the NCLEX.
