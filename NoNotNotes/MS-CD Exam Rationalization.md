1. A 46-year-old with Dengue has a nursing diagnosis of deficient fluid volume related to excessive fluid loss. Which action related to the fluid management should be delegated to a nursing assitant?
	1. Administer IV fluids as prescribed by the physician.
	2. Develop plan for dark colored food intake.
	3. **Provide straw and offer fluids between meals.**
	4. Teach family members to monitor trends in blood pressure.
>[!INFO] Dengue
>Dengue is caused by an arbovirus of the family (Flavi viridae) transferred via vector (**vector-borne**) by the female *Aedis aegypti* or *Aedis albupictus* characterized by white stripes.
>- The major nursing diagnosis in dengue is a fluid volume deficit.
>- The only medication that can be given for dengue is **paracetamol**.
>- Dengue has a characteristic **maculopapular rash** known as **Herman's sign**.
>- Monitor platelets and hematocrit (bleeding from thrombocytopenia, hemoconcentration from dehydration)

>[!INFO] Mosquitoes as Vectors
>**Viruses**: (no drug of choice for viral infections)
>1. Zika Virus
>2. Jap. B enceph.
>3. Chikangunya
>4. Dengue
>
>**Parasites**:
>1. Protozoa: plasmodium (malaria \[pathog: fever, chills\]), treated with co-arten and chloroquine
>2. Metazoa: worms, helminths, wucheriria (Filariasis A.K.A. elephantiasis; hetrazan) 

2. Following an episode of cholera, the nursing diagnosis includes decreased cardiac output related to decreased plasma volume. Which finding on assessment supports this nursing diagnosis?
	1. **Flattened neck veins when client is in supine position**
	2. Pitting edema on dorsum of foot
	3. Bounding dorsalis pedis pulse
	4. JVP elevation and crackles
>[!INFO] Cholera
>Cholera is an **enteric infection** travelling via the **fecal-oral route**, often ingested through contaminated food and water. Counteracting its transmission is simply enforcing proper hand hygiene and proper food preparation. Cholera is part of the Take Care Po Ha mnemonic: typhoid, cholera, polio, hepatitis A&E, and amoebiasis.

>[!INFO] Fluid Volume
>1. Decreased cardiac output produces flat neck veins, clear lungs, dry mucous membranes (lips, tongue), and non-palpable pulses. CVP is below 2 mm Hg.
>2. Increased cardiac output produces distended neck veins, congestive heart failure, crackles, moist lips, and edema. CVP is above 8 mm Hg/6 mm H2O

3. The nursing care plan for the client with dehydration from typhoid includes interventions for oral health. Which interventions are within the scope of practice of practice for the LPN?
	1. Remind client to take antidiarrheals.
	2. Assess mucous membranes for dryness.
	3. Encourage mouth rinsing with warm saline.
	4. **Provide mouth care every two hours while the client is awake.**
4. The recommendation for a daily diet that the nurse should reinforce in a client with COVID is:
	1. Wheat bread and coffee
	2. Vitamin supplements only
	3. Yogurt, canned fruits and brocolli
	4. **Meat, fruits, vegetables, milk, and grains**
>[!INFO] COVID-19
>COVI**D**: **Droplet**, potentially **airborne** if there is an aerosolized generating procedure such as intubation and nebulization.
>- **Etiologic agent**: SARS-Cov-2 of the Beta coronavirus family. SARS-Cov is responsible for SARS: Severe acute respiratory syndrome
>- **Signs and symptoms**: (early) ageusia (loss of taste) and anosmia (loss of smell). The pathognomonic sign of COVID-19 is a **ground glass appearance** found upon CXR or CT scan.
>- **Drugs**: remedisivir, motnubiravir, baricitinib, tocilizumab

5. 18 days after ICU admission from sepsis, the client complains of DOB. The client manifests:
	1. Compartment syndrome %%(found in fractures)%%
	2. Fat embolism syndrome %%(found in fractures)%%
	3. **Pulmonary embolism**
	4. Disequilibrium syndrome %%(found in hemodialysis)%%

>[!INFO] Syndromes
>1. **Compartment Syndrome**: caused by casts that are too tight. This manifests six Ps: firstly pain, paresthesia, pulselessness, pallor, poikilothermia, and lastly paralysis. The management is fasciotomy performed by a doctor.
>2. **Fat Embolism Syndrome**: **petechiae**, **hypotension**, **tachycardia**, **tachypnea**. Ensure airway patency and assist in potential intubation. This is found in fractures of the long or large bones (femur, pelvis).
>3. **Pulmonary Embolism**: commonly a complication of immobility, along with DVT.
>4. **Deep Vein Thrombosis**: a result of Virchow's triad (venous stasis, vessel wall injury, hypercoaguability). Remember **Homan's sign** (calf pain upon dorsiflexion) to check for DVTs.
>	- Management is done with **antiembolic stockings** and **anticoagulants**: **heparin** (prep. protamine sulfate; monitor PTT), **warfarin** (Coumadin) (prep. vitamin K \[Aquamephyton\]; monitor PT and INR). Bleeding precautions are put in place when the patient is on anticoagulant. Other anticoagulants (novel anticoagulants) are Apixaban, Rivaroxaban, and Bivalirodin


6. When a client is immobilized following meningitis, the most effective method of preventing contractures of the joints of the lower extremities would be:
	1. Turning positions every two hours %%(done for pressure ulcers)%%
	2. **Maintaining proper bed positions** %%(done for contractures)%%
	3. Passively moving the extremities through range-of-motion once a day %%(done for deep vein thrombosis)%%
	4. Providing the client with active exercise instructions

>[!INFO] Meningitis
>**Meningitis** is an infection (bacterial \[Neiserria meningitidis in adults, Haemophilus influenzae in children, Strep. agalactiae/Group B. Strep in newborns, E. coli, Listeria monocystogenes\], viral, fungal \[Cryptococcus\]) of the meninges
>- Photophobia, Nuchal rigidity (stiff neck; pathognomonic), Brudzinsky's sign, Kernig's sign.
