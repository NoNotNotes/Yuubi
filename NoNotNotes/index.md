<script type="text/javascript">
    function generateCountdown() {
        let element = document.getElementsByClassName('countdown')[0];
        let msRemaining = Date.parse('2025-11-04') - new Date();
        element.innerHTML = Math.floor(msRemaining / 1000 / 86400) + ' days';
    }

    if (window.addEventListener) { // For modern browsers
        window.addEventListener('load', generateCountdown, false);        // On initial load
        window.addEventListener('pageshow', generateCountdown, false);    // On navigation back
    } else if (window.attachEvent) { // For older IE browsers
        window.attachEvent('onload', generateCountdown);
        window.attachEvent('onpageshow', generateCountdown);
    }
</script>

Hopefully complete on or within the next <code class="countdown"></code>. The name saying "No Not Note(s)" is just a bit of wordplay I thought of. These are definitely notes.

>[!FAQ] PDFs?
> I'm avoiding formatting these notes as PDFs because I plan on updating, expanding, and polishing notes as I find more information on them. I'll probably keep updating these even after I graduate (for NCLEX and CPD purposes). If you really want a PDF, [ilovepdf](https://www.ilovepdf.com/html-to-pdf) has an HTML-to-PDF converter that I like, but it's not perfect. Some text can get cut off between pages.
