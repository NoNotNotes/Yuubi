Quantitative: Pearson Correlation
___
# Experimental Research
A research design where **researchers are active agents** and not merely a passive observer. The researcher **consciously manipulates the conditions** in the study and makes observations in a tightly controlled environment.
- It seeks to determine if a specific variable influences an outcome through the study of two groups: a control and a treatment group.
- Includes **true experiments**, with randomization; or **quasi-experiments**, with non-randomized assignment of subjects.
# Non-Experimental
Does not use manipulative and control of the independent variable and conducted mostly in the natural setting under natural conditions.
# Statistics
Deals with logical collection, organization, presentation, analysis, and interpretation of numerical data.
## Descriptive Statistics
1. Mean
2. Median
3. Mode
4. Range
5. Variance
6. Std. Deviation
## Inferential Statistics
1. Measure of Association
- For two variables, rank them and find the difference between both ranks, then square.
- strength of correlation ![[pearson_correlation_strengths.png]]
* Pearson is the most common*
	* Used for a 2x2 matrix (computed by a statistician)

# Writing Guidelines
1. Add a title to every table. Check samples for italicization and bolding.
2. Tables should be made as three-liner tables.
4. Analyze the table and present it qualitatively. However, the table should also be able to understand the table without external contexts.
5. Provide data collection proof: recordings, survey forms, ICF
