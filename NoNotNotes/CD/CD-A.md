**Communicable Disease** (CD) is one the core concepts of community health nursing. These diseases, including those like malaria, tuberculosis, and leprosy, are main target diseases of the DOH and WHO for eradication because of their prevalence.

# Introduction to CD
## Epidemiology
**Epidemiology** is the backbone of disease prevention. It studies the **occurrences**, **distribution**, and **determinants** of health-related states or events in specified populations. Epidemiology is centered around **biostatistics**. The **Father of Epidemiology** is **John Snow**, an anesthesiologist who set out to study a **cholera outbreak** in 1854 in the Golden Square of Soho District, London. He determined that water well was the point source for infection by **spot mapping**.
1. **Distribution**: **descriptive epidemiology** to answer the when, where, and who of the disease by determining demographic profiles. The disease may then be defined by **time**, **place** and **person** (**age**, **sex**, **occupation**).
	- For conducting descriptive epidemiology, a **survey** is used because the researcher is focusing on a **special population**. If the entire population is concerned, a **census** is used.
	- **Patterns of Occurrence and Distribution**:
		1. **Sporadic**: **rare**, scattered, unrelated cases. Good examples of this is tetanus and rabies.
		2. **Endemic**: continuously occurring disease in a **specific geographic boundary**. Good examples of this (in the Philippines) is malaria, filariasis, leprosy, and schistosomiasis.
		3. **Epidemic**: an unusual spike in cases of a disease in a short period. These may be due to **point sources** e.g., food poisoning of 100 individuals at a party, **cyclical patterns** e.g. dengue fever from July to November, **secular trend**, e.g. influenza, a long-term elevation in the number of cases, and **propagated**, e.g. HIV
		4. **Pandemic**: a multi-national simultaneous occurrence of a disease affecting a large number of the population. A good example of this is **COVID-19**.
2. **Determinant**: **analytic epidemiology** to answer the why and how of the disease by determining **cause and effects**, **risk factors**, and **modes of transmission**.

>[!TIP] Key Points
>1. **In public health nursing**, the main epidemiologic function of a nurse is **surveillance**; monitoring and reporting the occurrence and distribution of disease.
>2. **Epidemiologic Triad**: the **host** (person, usually), **agent** (etiologic factor; pathogen), and **environment** (extrinsic factors).
>![[epidemiologic_triad.png]]
>3. **Epidemiologic Laws**:
>	- **R.A. 3573**: the law on **reporting of notifiable diseases**. Midwives and nurses are required to report to provincial and duty health office for notifiable diseases:
>		- **Measles** and **poliomyelitis**: within **24 hours**, as these are highly communicable.
>		- **Tetanus neonatorum**, **severe and acute diarrhea**, and **HIV**: within **one week**.
>	- **R.A. 11332**: the law on **mandatory reporting of notifiable diseases**.
## Viruses
**Viruses** are the smallest forms of microorganisms, with no nucleus. Their anucleic property makes their status as "living" controversial.
- **Often self-limiting**. Viral diseases are often self-limiting and will resolve by itself with minimal intervention.
- Viruses **do not elevate white blood cell count**. If signs of infection are present, but WBC is not high, the infectious agent is likely viral.
>[!EXAMPLE] Viral Diseases
>1. Measles/Rubeola (7-day Measles)
>2. German Measles/Rubella (3-day Measles)
>3. Mumps (Parotitis)
>4. Varicella (Chickenpox)
>5. Poliomyelitis; Infantile Paralysis
>6. HIV/AIDS
>7. Herpes Simples Virus; Zoster
>8. Hepatitis A, B, C, D, E
>9. Influenza
>10. COVID-19
>11. Rabies
>12. Dengue

## Bacteria
**Bacteria** may be non-self-limiting, and will **increase the white blood cell count** of an infected person.

>[!EXAMPLE] Bacterial Diseases
>1. Tuberculosis
>2. Leptospirosis
>3. Leprosy
>4. Pertussis
>5. Diphtheria
>6. Tetanus
>7. Syphillis
>8. Gonorrhea
>9. Chlamydia
>10. Cholera
>11. Typhoid Fever
>12. Pneumonia
>13. Sepsis/Septicemia
>14. Anthrax
>15. Meningitis

## Parasites
Infective agents that will **increase immunoglobulin E (IgE)**.

>[!EXAMPLE] Parasitic Diseases
>1. Malaria
>2. Schistosomiasis
>3. Filariasis
>4. Scabies
>5. Helminthiasis
>6. Girdiasis

## Fungi

>[!EXAMPLE] Fungal Infections
>1. Ringworm
>2. Tinea Flava
>3. Athlete's Foot
>4. Candidiasis
>5. Moniliasis

## Chain of Infection
The **chain of infection** is a model used in communicable disease to outline the process by which an infective agent (the first link in the chain) reaches a susceptible host (the last link in the chain). This is an important tool to combat communicable diseases. The following are the six links in the chain of infection, and how each one may be broken.
1. **Agent**: the microorganism capable of producing disease.
	-  This is broken using **disinfection** (removing microorganisms) and **sterilization** (removing microorganisms and spores). This can be achieved through physical and chemical methods.
		- The most common method for sterilization in hospitals is **autoclaving**, the application of heat and pressure at 15 PPI, 121°C/250°F.
		- In lower-level facilities, sterilization is done with **chemical soaking**.
		- At home, sterilization can be done with **boiling**.
2. **Reservoir**: the location where the microorganism remains. This may be other organisms (humans, animals, insects) or contaminated food, soil, and water.
	- Human reservoirs: **measles**, **mumps**, **HIV**, **STDs**. People who carry the disease, yet does not show outward signs of infection are called **carriers**.
	- Animal reservoirs: **anthrax** (sheep), **rabies** (dogs)
	- Environment reservoirs: **histoplasmosis** (soil), **toxoplasmosis** (cat feces)
3. **Portal of Exit**: a method by which microorganisms exit the reservoir. In humans, this can be through secretions (except tear and sweat; these are antimicrobial— they are part of the chemical barriers of the immune system), bodily fluids, sexual contact, etc.
4. **Mode of Transmission**: the medium that the microorganisms travel by. This is generally divided between **contact** (most common), **droplet** (travels ~1 meter), **airborne** (travels >1 meter), and the **fecal-oral route** (ingestion of contaminated items).
	- The **weakest link** of the chain of infection as it is easily broken. **The most effective method of preventing infection is handwashing**.
5. **Portal of Entry**: a method by which microorganisms can enter a new host. This can be through breaks in the skin, the eyes, or other openings in the mucosa.
	- 
6. **Susceptible Host**: a host adequately susceptible to the microorganism entering. This may be anyone, but is more likely for children (<5 years old, prior to immune system maturity), older adults, unimmunized people, and the immunocompromised.
>[!TIP] Key Points
>1. **High-level Disinfection** is done with a 1:10 ratio of bleach to water.
>2. **Autoclaving is considered complete** once the black strips on the autoclave tape have turned black.
