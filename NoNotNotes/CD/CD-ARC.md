**Communicable Disease** (CD) is one the core concepts of community health nursing. These diseases, including those like malaria, tuberculosis, and leprosy, are main target diseases of the DOH and WHO for eradication because of their prevalence.

# Introduction to CD
## Epidemiology
**Epidemiology** is the backbone of disease prevention. It studies the **occurrences**, **distribution**, and **determinants** of health-related states or events in specified populations. Epidemiology is centered around **biostatistics**. The **Father of Epidemiology** is **John Snow**, an anesthesiologist who set out to study a **cholera outbreak** in 1854 in the Golden Square of Soho District, London. He determined that water well was the point source for infection by **spot mapping**.
1. **Distribution**: **descriptive epidemiology** to answer the when, where, and who of the disease by determining demographic profiles. The disease may then be defined by **time**, **place** and **person** (**age**, **sex**, **occupation**).
	- For conducting descriptive epidemiology, a **survey** is used because the researcher is focusing on a **special population**. If the entire population is concerned, a **census** is used.
	- **Patterns of Occurrence and Distribution**:
		1. **Sporadic**: **rare**, scattered, unrelated cases. Good examples of this is tetanus and rabies.
		2. **Endemic**: continuously occurring disease in a **specific geographic boundary**. Good examples of this (in the Philippines) is malaria, filariasis, leprosy, and schistosomiasis.
		3. **Epidemic**: an unusual spike in cases of a disease in a short period. These may be due to **point sources** e.g., food poisoning of 100 individuals at a party, **cyclical patterns** e.g. dengue fever from July to November, **secular trend**, e.g. influenza, a long-term elevation in the number of cases, and **propagated**, e.g. HIV
		4. **Pandemic**: a multi-national simultaneous occurrence of a disease affecting a large number of the population. A good example of this is **COVID-19**.
2. **Determinant**: **analytic epidemiology** to answer the why and how of the disease by determining **cause and effects**, **risk factors**, and **modes of transmission**.

>[!TIP] Key Points
>1. **In public health nursing**, the main epidemiologic function of a nurse is **surveillance**; monitoring and reporting the occurrence and distribution of disease.
>2. **Epidemiologic Triad**: the **host** (person, usually), **agent** (etiologic factor; pathogen), and **environment** (extrinsic factors).
>![[epidemiologic_triad.png]]
>3. **Epidemiologic Laws**:
>	- **R.A. 3573**: the law on **reporting of notifiable diseases**. Midwives and nurses are required to report to provincial and duty health office for notifiable diseases:
>		- **Measles** and **poliomyelitis**: within **24 hours**, as these are highly communicable.
>		- **Tetanus neonatorum**, **severe and acute diarrhea**, and **HIV**: within **one week**.
>	- **R.A. 11332**: the law on **mandatory reporting of notifiable diseases**.
## Viruses
**Viruses** are the smallest forms of microorganisms, with no nucleus. Their anucleic property makes their status as "living" controversial.
- **Often self-limiting**. Viral diseases are often self-limiting and will resolve by itself with minimal intervention.
- Viruses **do not elevate white blood cell count**. If signs of infection are present, but WBC is not high, the infectious agent is likely viral.
>[!EXAMPLE] Viral Diseases
>1. Measles/Rubeola (7-day Measles)
>2. German Measles/Rubella (3-day Measles)
>3. Mumps (Parotitis)
>4. Varicella (Chickenpox)
>5. Poliomyelitis; Infantile Paralysis
>6. HIV/AIDS
>7. Herpes Simples Virus; Zoster
>8. Hepatitis A, B, C, D, E
>9. Influenza
>10. COVID-19
>11. Rabies
>12. Dengue

## Bacteria
**Bacteria** may be non-self-limiting, and will **increase the white blood cell count** of an infected person.

>[!EXAMPLE] Bacterial Diseases
>1. Tuberculosis
>2. Leptospirosis
>3. Leprosy
>4. Pertussis
>5. Diphtheria
>6. Tetanus
>7. Syphillis
>8. Gonorrhea
>9. Chlamydia
>10. Cholera
>11. Typhoid Fever
>12. Pneumonia
>13. Sepsis/Septicemia
>14. Anthrax
>15. Meningitis

## Parasites
Infective agents that will **increase immunoglobulin E (IgE)**.

>[!EXAMPLE] Parasitic Diseases
>1. Malaria
>2. Schistosomiasis
>3. Filariasis
>4. Scabies
>5. Helminthiasis
>6. Girdiasis

## Fungi

>[!EXAMPLE] Fungal Infections
>1. Ringworm
>2. Tinea Flava
>3. Athlete's Foot
>4. Candidiasis
>5. Moniliasis

# Q&A
## Test 01
1. In communicable disease, what microorganism is considered by scientists and microbiologists as non-living?
2. A disease which is caused by the ingestion of contaminated protein products that causes spasmodic abdominal pain.
3. A type of helminthiasis often acquired through the ingestion of contaminated pork or beef products.
4. What is the reservoir for the pathologic agent responsible for measles?
5. What is the mode of transmission of varicella?
6. What is the primary method of prevention for tuberculosis?
7. What is the new law mandating the reporting of communicable diseases and emerging deceases/public health concerns?
8. What is the mode of transmission of poliomyelitis?
9. What is the principal vector for rabies?
10. What is the pathognomonic sign of pertussis?
>[!FAQ]- Answers
>1. **Virus**. These do not have nuclei, and require a host to survive, leading to controversy about its status as a living organism.
>2. **Salmonellosis**, known as **salmonella** is characteristically caused by spoiled protein products.
>3. **Taeniasis**, known as **tapeworms** are commonly found in pork and beef products.
>4. **Humans** are the only reservoir for measles.
>5. Varicella, also known as **chickenpox**, can become **airborne**.
>6. **Immunization**, specifically using the **BCG vaccine**, is the primary method for preventing tuberculosis.
>7. **R.A. 11332**. This may be confused with R.A. 11223, which is about universal healthcare.
>8. Poliomyelitis is transmitted through the **fecal-oral route**; ingestion.
>9. Rabies is primarily carried by **dogs**.
>10. **Whooping cough** is the pathognomonic sign for pertussis.
