A syndrome diagnosed through multiple motor ticks and one or more vocal tics, which occur many times a day for more than 1 year. Complexity and severity of tics change over time. Significant impairment of academic, social, or occupational areas is experienced, with the individual often feeling ashamed and self-conscious.
- Blinking, neck-jerking, shrugging, grimacing, coughing, clearing the throat, grunting, sniffing, snorting, **coprolalia** (socially unacceptable speech; expletives), **palilalia** (repeating one's own words or sounds), **echolalia** (repeating others' words or sounds), facial gestures, jumping, touching or smelling an object. Almost all of the following described will be experienced throughout an individual's lifetime.
- Treated with atypical antipsychotics: **risperidone** (Risperdal), **aripiprazole** (Abilify), and **pimozide** (Orap)
- May be concomitant with [[B317/09|Autism Spectrum Disorder]]

**Chronic motor or tic disorders** differ from Tourette's in that either motor or vocal tics are present, but not both.
