Diet and nutrition are not only critical for human physiology and body composition, but also have significant effects on mood and mental wellbeing. While the determining factors of mental health are complex, **increasing evidence indicates a strong association** (yet links are only beginning to emerge) **between a poor diet and the exacerbation of mood disorders** e.g. anxiety and depression.
- **Nutritional deficiencies may relate correlate with some mental disorders**. The most common deficiencies in mental disorder patients are of **omega-3 fatty acids**, **B vitamins**, **minerals**, and **neurotransmitter-precursor amino acids**.
- **Population studies** have shown compelling evidence to link **high fish consumption to lower mental disorder incidence** as a direct result of omega-3 fatty acid intake. The generally accepted daily dose is one to two grams. **In patients with mental disorders, up to 9.6 grams have been shown to be safe and efficacious**.
