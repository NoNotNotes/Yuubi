Skipped morning gen-ed classes. Woke up late and didn't want to stress over rushing to class. I'm counting on the kindness of their hearts and my shallow attempts to garner pity and allow them to give me a passing grade.

Studied the rest of the eye disorders (except for tumors and cytomegalovirus retinitis) from the book. Going to be studying the video lectures and course modules soon to see any other information or missed topics (I know Pott's Disease has been missing from my musculoskeletal study). I'll start reviewing after all of that information has been collated. I'll use my own notes, then external sources (probably just NurseLabs).

Got in the library at 10:50 AM, and out of the library at 5:05 PM. Someone informed me that there was a CA session today. Glad I could make it. There were a lot of people, but I still managed to nab a seat up front. It ended at around 7:30 PM, and I made my way back to the library. I reformatted the live notes, but didn't end up studying anything new. It would feel odd to start a new chapter and end before I could make any significant progress (I definitely could have, but I was tired...) I made my way home at around 9:30 PM after napping at the library. Got home minutes before a strong downpour, lucky.

Added some new topics to my wall. Anything I could muster up in my mind was in there, barring niche specific topics.
