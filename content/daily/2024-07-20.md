Still no WiFi. Woke up at 4:00 AM, then at 8:30 AM. I've been having more and more vivid dreams lately. I swear I had a lucid dream the other day. It was partially a nightmare where I was being chased or something, but I realized the dreaminess of it and basically obliterated whatever it was. I should've added a dream journal portion to it yesterday. I'll try to do so whenever a dream stands out to me. I'll continue studying.

We have a rehearsal later at 1:00 PM, I hope it'll be productive and regular.
