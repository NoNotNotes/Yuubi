Finally doing my daily journal thing outlining my daily activities. Today wasn't especially happy, but I'm not sad. I feel good because I'm being productive without just outright burning myself out (so far, to my knowledge).

Spent the day in the library for the third day in a row. Didn't bring lunch food this time, for god knows what reason. Hunger satiated by piaya and candy.

Awfully slow progress on the lectures. Continued studying the assessment of the musculoskeletal function today, based off of the Brunner-Suddarth book. Way too long, and I highly doubt that most of the information I wrote about will be useful for our examinations.
