Still no WiFi. Woke up at 6:00 AM, then at 9:00 AM. Getting food and getting ready to start studying again.

I studied more than I did the previous day. The topics are basic, but a review's a review. Still played quite a bit of Celeste. What an infuriating level chapter 3 is. Nothing interesting really happened.

I finished Horimiya's second season. It's so bittersweet. I couldn't drown out the gaping hole in my happy chemicals once it was over because I didn't have the connection to watch shitposts on YouTube. Amidst all of the joy, cuteness, and fulfillment the anime displayed my own feelings of longing for those kinds of experiences (no matter how toxic basing real-life on idealized media is) still stuck out. I never had a high school sweetheart, nor a college sweetheart at this rate. I might only experience the type of serious romance that adults have, and not the juvenile, happy-go-lucky or absolutely destructive type that my juniors can have. Or who knows, maybe I can find someone who still lingers in that realm of silliness and humor.

I swapped between sleeping, playing, and studying (and eating) for the entire day. Also finished work on one of the mass songs' MP3 guide. It was a good day. I slept earlier than usual.
