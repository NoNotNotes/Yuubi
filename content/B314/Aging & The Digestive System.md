# GIT Changes in Older Adults
Physiologic changes occur as individuals age, especially at the **age of 65 and older**. Overall changes of the digestive system involved in aging include:
1. **Oral Cavity and Pharynx**: difficulty chewing and swallowing
	- Injury, loss, or decay of teeth
	- Atrophy of taste buds
	- Saliva production and enzyme content (ptyalin, amylase) are decreased
2. **Esophagus**: reflux and heartburn
	- Decreased motility and slower emptying
	- Weakened gag reflex
	- Decreased resting pressure of the lower esophageal sphincter.
3. **Stomach**: food intolerances, malabsorption, decreased Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> absorption
	- Degeneration and atrophy of gastric mucosal surfaces with decreased HCl production.
	- Decreased secretion of gastric acids and most digestive enzymes
	- Decreased gastric motility and emptying
4. **Small Intestine**: decreased motility and transit time; resultant indigestion and constipation.
	- Atrophy of muscle and mucosal surfaces.
	- Thinning of villi and epithelial cells.
5. **Large Intestine**: decreased motility and transit time; resultant indigestion and constipation, decreased absorption of nutrients (dextrose, fats, calcium, iron), fecal incontinence.
	- Decreased mucus secretion (by the Goblet cells)
	- Decreased elasticity of rectal walls (lower capacity)
	- Decreased tone of internal anal sphincter
	- Slower and duller nerve impulses in the rectal area
