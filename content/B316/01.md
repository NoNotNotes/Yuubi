# Physical Assessment
- **Nutritional Status**
-  **Anthropometric Measurement**: nutritional status, height, weight, BMI
- The mouth, pharynx, abdomen, and extremities.
## Abdominal Assessment
- **Have the client void, lie supine with knees bent, and keep the arms at the side**. This should relax the abdominal muscles.
- **IAPePa** (as opposed to the usual **IPaPeA**): Inspection, Percussion, Palpation, Auscultation
    - Leave the reported areas with pain as the last areas to check, as pain causes involuntary abdominal tension, impeding on the assessment.
    - Observe for signs of pain: grimacing
    - Starting from the RUQ, clockwise around each quadrant
- **Cullen's Sign**: ecchymosis (bruising) around the umbilicus is indicative of intra-abdominal bleeding.
- **Abdominal movements** indicate intestinal obstruction (hyperperistalsis). These are rarely seen upon inspection.
## Auscultation
- **High-pitched Gurgles**: movement of air and fluid; q5-15s; 5-30 sounds/min.
	- **Hyperactive**: 30 sounds in 1 minute.
	- **Hypoactive**: 1-2 sounds in 2 minutes. Diminished or absent gurgling may be observed after abdominal surgery, with peritonitis, or a paralytic ileus.
	- **Absent**: no sounds in 3 to 5 minutes.
- **Borborygmus**: loud gurgling sounds due to **hypermotility** of the bowel e.g. in gastroenteritis, diarrhea, or complete intestinal obstruction.
- **Bruit**: "*swooshing sounds*" that indicate an [[aneurysm]] (AAA), especially if heard over the **abdominal aorta**. **Avoid percussion or palpation if observed; rupturing the aneurysm is life-threatening**.
## Percussion
This method is used to determine and estimate the size of solid organs such as the liver and the spleen, the presence of masses, of fluids, and of air.
- **Tympanic**: high-pitched, loud musical sound of an air-filled space.
- **Dull**: medium-pitched, softer, thud-like sound over a solid organ.
## Palpation
This method (light and deep) is used to determine the size and location of abdominal organs and assess the presence of masses or tenderness (pain).
- **Blumberg's Sign**: rebound tenderness; pain felt when pressure from fingers pressing perpendicular to the abdomen is removed.
___
# Diagnostic Assessments
## Blood Tests
- **Complete blood count** (CBC): GI bleeding may result in acute or chronic anemia.
- **Prothrombin Time** (PT): Liver damage will prolong an individual's PT due to its role in the production of coagulation factors.
- **Serum Electrolytes**: GI malabsorption, excessive vomiting, and excessive diarrhea may all result in electrolyte imbalance.
- **Aspartate Aminotransferase** (AST), **Alanine Aminotransferase** (ALT): these are liver function tests. AST and ALT levels are raised in chronic alcoholics and patients with viral hepatitis.%%This is due to the increased rate of removal of these enzymes from the body.%%
- **Serum Amylase & Lipase**: the best indicator of acute pancreatitis if elevated within 1 to 5 days.
- **Bilirubin Levels**: evaluation of liver and biliary tract functioning.
- **Serum Ammonia**: evaluation of hepatic function. Ammonia is used to rebuild amino acids or is converted to urea and excreted.
## Urine Tests
- **Urine Amylase**: increased in acute pancreatitis. This may remain high even after serum levels return to normal.
- **Urobilinogen**: indicative of hepatic and biliary obstruction.
## Stool Tests
- **Fecal Occult Blood Test**: test for GI bleeding.
- **Parasitic Infection**
- **Fecal Fats** (steatorrhea): malabsorption.
## Plain Abdominal X-Ray
- Also referred to as a **KUB** (Kidney, Ureter, Bladder) **X-Ray**; a **Flat Plate of the Abdomen**. Used for detection of **masses**, **tumors**, **structures**, or **obstructions**. There are no special preparations required for this test.
## Upper GI Series and Small Bowel Series
- X-ray of the Upper GI structures from the **oral pharynx to the duodenojejunal junction**. Used for the detection of **esophageal** (with a barium swallow), **gastric**, or **duodenal** disorders and function.
- **Up to the ileocecal junction** with a **small bowel follow-through** (SBFT)
- The barium preparation is traced by **fluoroscopy** through the esophagus and stomach.
### Client Preparation
- **8 hours NPO** before the procedure. Withhold **opioid analgesics** and **anticholinergics 24 hours before** the test, as these decrease motility.
- The client must drink ~16 ounces of **barium preparation**.
### Post-procedure Considerations
- **Plenty of fluids** should be given to **eliminate ingested barium**.
- **Mild laxatives or stool softeners can be given**.
- Advise clients that **stool may be chalky white** for 1 to 2 days as barium is excreted.
## Lower GI Series (Barium Enema)
- Radiographic visualization of the large intestine. This detects bowel obstructions due to the twisting of the colon upon itself (**volvulus**).
- **Contraindication**: suspected **colon perforation or fistula**. This may cause **cardiac arrest** if barium enters venous circulation.
### Client Preparation
- **All preparations are related to reducing fecal content of the colon for the procedure**.
- **Clear liquid diet** 12 to 24 hours before the procedure to reduce fecal matter in the bowel.
- **NPO** the night before the procedure.
- **Potent laxatives** or a **cleansing enema** is performed the evening before the test.
### Post-procedure Considerations
- Advise the client to **drink plenty of water** (to eliminate barium)
- **Mild laxatives or stool softeners can be given**.
- **Chalky white stool** may persist for 1 to 3 days until all barium is expelled.
## Percutaneous Transhepatic Cholangiography (PTC)
- **Iodinated dye** (contrast medium) is instilled via a **percutaneous needle through the liver into the intrahepatic ducts** with x-ray guidance. This is now an uncommon diagnostic procedure. The needle is inserted into the left hepatic ducts, so **the patient is placed on the right side**.
- Observe for **bleeding**, **hematoma**, **ecchymosis**, or **bile leakage**.
## Computed Tomography (CT) Scan
- A non-invasive **cross-sectional x-ray visualization** detecting tissue densities and abnormalities in the abdomen and the structures in it.  It can be performed with or without a contrast medium. As usual, **check for seafood or iodine allergies**.
- **No particular follow-up care** is required **unless sedatives were used**. **Monitor VS** until the client is fully awake.
## Endoscopy
- **Direct visualization of the GIT** by means of a **flexible fiberoptic endoscope**. This is often used to evaluate bleeding, ulceration, inflammation, masses, tumors, and cancerous lesions.
### Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)
- Upper endoscopy; a visual examination of the upper GI tract: the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. This may also include a biopsy.
#### Client Preparation
- Medications used: **Midazolam HCl** (sedative), **Meperedine** (Demerol) (sedative), **Fentanyl**, **Atropine** (reduces secretions and vagal responses), **Local Anesthetics** (inactivates gag reflex and facilitates passage of tube).
#### Post-procedure Considerations
- **Monitor VS q30m** until sedation wears off. Put side rails up to prevent falls.
- **NPO until gag reflex returns** (often in 1 to 2 hours) to avoid aspiration.
- WOF: **Signs of Perforation** (Pain, Bleeding, Fever)
### Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)
- Visual and radiographic examination of the **liver**, **gallbladder**, **bile ducts**, and **pancreas** to identify cause & location of obstruction. After the cannula is inserted into the **common bile duct** radio-opaque dye is inserted followed by **x-ray examination**.
- For removal of gallstones, a small incision (papillotomy) may be made at the **ampulla of Vater** (hepatopancreatic duct).
- The same preparations apply as for an **EGD**.
### Colonoscopy
- Examination of the large bowel (colon). It is used to identify causes of **chronic diarrhea**, **sources of bleeding**, **tissue biopsies**, or to **remove polyps**.
#### Client Preparation
- **Liquid diet for 12 to 24** hours before the procedure
- **NPO for 6 to 8 hours** before the procedure
- **Laxatives, Suppositories, Cleansing Enemas** to **clean the bowel the night before** the procedure.
- **Sedation**, preparation of **Atropine Sulfate** to prevent vasovagal responses from causing bradycardia.
#### Post-procedure Considerations
- **Monitor VS q15m** until the patient is stable. **Keep the side rails up** (prevent from falls) and observe for signs of perforation (bleeding, fever, pain).
### Proctosigmoidoscopy
- Examination of the **rectum** and **sigmoid colon**. Either a rigid or a flexible scope may be used.
- Screens for colon cancer, GI bleeding, diagnosis or monitoring of inflammatory bowel disease.
#### Client Preparation
- **Liquid diet** for at least 24 hours before the procedure
- **Laxatives** the evening before, and **cleansing enema** the morning before the procedure.
- **Positioning**: left-side lying in the knee-chest position.
- No sedation is required because of the shallow depth.
#### Post-procedure Considerations
- Inform the client that **mild gas pain and flatulence may be experienced** because of air introduced by the procedure.
- If a biopsy was involved, **slight bleeding may be observed**. However, **excessive bleeding should be immediately reported**.
## Gastric Analysis
- Measures the hydrochloric acid and pepsin content of the stomach in order to determine aggressive gastric and duodenal disorders ([[Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome]])
## Ultrasound
- Sound waves are passed through the body via a **transducer**, in which the "echoes" of the sound waves are recorded as images for analysis. It is commonly used to image soft tissue such as the **liver**, **spleen**, the **pancreas**, and **gallbladder** (biliary system). 
- A **full bladder** is required for some forms of this procedure because a full bladder will move organs out of the way, as well as because the sound waves travel better through fluids than through air.
