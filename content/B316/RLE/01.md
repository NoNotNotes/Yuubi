title: Neurologic Assessment
description: A neurologic examination to assess mental status, cranial nerve status, the sensory system, motor system, cerebellar, and reflexes.
---
The neurological system controls cognitive/voluntary behavioral processes and the subconscious/involuntary bodily functions. A neurologic examination is organized into six major areas: mental status (also read: [[B317/02-3|MSE]]), cranial nerves, sensory systems, motor systems, cerebellar function, and reflexes.
___
# Neurologic Exam
1. **Health History**: head injury, loss of consciousness, headaches, vertigo, dizziness, fainting, paresthesia, weakness, recent changes in ADL performance, change in mental status, vision, speech, gait abnormalities (balance, coordination, falls), drooling, dysphagia, seizures, tremors, infections, meningitis, encephalitis, circulatory problems, medications that may affect any faculty of the nervous system (coordination, mental status, etc.)
	- **Family History**: hereditary disorders, Tay-Sachs Disease, muscular dystrophy, PKU, mental retardation, Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type
	- **Developmental Considerations**
2. **General Signs and Symptoms**: memory loss, disorientation, changes in the level of consciousness, seizures, speech or swallowing difficulties, vision and papillary changes, dizziness, headache/pain, weakness, ataxia, tremors, numbness, tingling, paralysis, nausea and vomiting, bowel or bladder difficulties
3. **Mental Status Examination**
4. **Physical Examination**
	- **Level of Consciousness** (GCS)
	- **Motor Function**
	- **Pupillary Function**/**Eye Movements**
	- **Vital Signs**
5. **Laboratory and Diagnostic Testing**
___
# Mental Status
**Level of Consciousness** (LOC) is the most important aspect of a neurologic examination, as **LOC is often the first to deteriorate in a pathologic process**. However, changes are often subtle and require careful monitoring. There are two components to consciousness:
1. **Arousal** (Alertness)
2. **Awareness** (Content): assessed via orientation vs. disorientation. The patient is questioned (in varying sequences) about their orientation to [[B317/02-3#Orientation|person, place, time, or situation]].
## Glasgow Coma Scale
A three-category test to score a patient's mental functioning out of 15 (lowest being 3). A score of **13 to 15** may only show for minor brain injuries, **9 to 12** for moderate brain injuries, and **3 to 8** for severe brain injuries.

| Category | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| **Alert** | Responds **immediately** to minimal external (visual, tactile, auditory) stimuli |
| **Lethargic** | A state of **drowsiness**; the client needs **increased external stimuli** to be awakened but remains easily aroused. **Verbal, mental, and motor responses are slow or sluggish**. |
| **Obtunded** | **Very drowsy** when not stimulated, but is able to follow simple commands when stimulated vigorously (shaken, shouting). Verbal responses are simple (few words) and the client will drift back to sleep without stimulation. |
| **Stuporous** | Awakens **only to vigorous and continuous noxious** (painful) **stimulation**. There is minimal spontaneous movement; motor response to pain is normal but **verbal responses are minimal and often incomprehensible** (moaning, groaning) |
| **Light Coma** | Vigorous stimulation **does not produce a response**. Only **motor responses to noxious stimuli are still purposeful**. |
| **Deep Coma** | Same as light coma, but **Motor responses to noxious stimuli are absent.** |
## Cranial Nerve Testing
| Nerve | Test |
| ---- | ---- |
| **Olfactory Nerve** (I) | Skipped unless facial trauma is present; smell test: **have the patient close their eyes and identify a common smell** e.g. a chocolate bar. |
| **Optic Nerve** (II) | **Identify fingers or movements in all quadrants and periphery in each eye**; blink to threat in temporal and nasal quadrants if unable to participate, or by using a Snellen chart to check visual acuity. |
| **Oculomotor Nerve** (III) | **Move eyes in all directions except outward, down, and inward**. The patient should be able to **open the eyelid and constrict the pupil**. |
| **Trochlear Nerve** (IV) | **Move eyes downward and inward**. |
| **Trigeminal Nerve** (V) | Split into three branches (sensation to face, cornea, and scalp). To test, **open the jaw against resistance**. |
| **Abducens Nerve** (VI) | **Move eyes outward** |
| **Facial Nerve** (VII) | Moves the face (smile, frown, raise eyebrows, show teeth, puff out cheeks, purse lips, close eyes against resistance); is able to taste. |
| **Acoustic Nerve** (VIII) | Split into two branches (acoustic, vestibular). **Weber and Rinne tests** and **Watch-tick Test** for hearing. **Romberg Test** (stand straight, feet together, arms to the side, then close eyes) for balance. |
| **Glossopharyngeal Nerve** (IX) | **Moves the pharynx** (swallow, talk, gag) |
| **Vagus Nerve** (X) | **Voice Quality** |
| **Spinal Accessory Nerve** (XI) | **Turns the head and elevates shoulders** (both can be done against resistance). Note symmetry.  |
| **Hypoglossal Nerve** (XII) | **Protrude the tongue**. It should be midline, stable, and has no wasting. Have the patient say "light, tight, dynamite". Speech should be clear and distinct. |
