# Overview
## Functions of the GIT
- **Ingestion**: taking in food.
- **Digestion**: breaking food down into nutrient molecules
- **Absorption**: the movement of nutrients from the food into the bloodstream
- **Defecation**: the excretion of indigestible wastes from ingested food
## The Alimentary Canal
The alimentary canal and organs are a part of the gastrointestinal system, which consists of all body parts which make up the hollow tube that starts from the mouth to the anus.
### Mouth
**Ingestion** and **digestion** begins with the mouth, where **mastication** (chewing) of food starts, which converts food into **bolus** by mixing **chewed food with saliva**. The tongue allows for **swallowing**, and is covered by **taste buds**, which allow for taste.
- **Mouth**
- **Lips**
- **Cheeks**
- **Hard Palate**
- **Soft Palate**
- **Uvula**
- **Vestibule**
- **Oral Cavity Proper**
- **Tongue**
- **Tonsils**: divided into the palatine and lingual tonsils.
### Pharynx
A passageway for food, fluid, and air into the esophagus or to the trachea. For food transportation, it moves from the mouth posteriorly into the **oropharynx**, then inferiorly into the **laryngopharynx**, which then continues into the esophagus. Superior to the oropharynx is the **nasopharynx**, which is connected to the nasal cavity. "Swallowing" occurs in the pharynx.
- Food is propelled into the esophagus from the pharynx by two muscles moving in a peristaltic manner: the **longitudinal outer layer** and the **circular inner layer**
### Esophagus
A ~10 inch long **pipe-like structure** that **transports food from the pharynx to the stomach**. It utilizes *slow, rhythmic movements* of the esophageal muscles in order to move food into the stomach. This is known as **peristalsis**.
### Layers of Tissue in the Alimentary Canal Organs
#### Mucosa
The innermost layer, moist membrane made up of:
- Surface epithelium, mostly made of simple columnar epithelium (except for the esophagus, which is made of stratified squamous epithelium) (Also read: [[ANPH/03|Body Tissues]])
- Small amounts of connective tissue (*lamina propria*) and a scanty smooth muscle layer. This lines the cavity (hollow part) of the alimentary canal, known as the **lumen**.
#### Submucosa
Just under the mucosa, it is made up of **soft connective tissue** that contains the blood vessels, nerve endings, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), and lymphatic vessels.
#### Muscularis Externa
Made up of smooth muscle with an **inner circular layer** and an **outer longitudinal layer**, which work together for peristalsis.
#### Serosa
The outermost layer of the wall; this contains fluid-producing cells. Divided into the **visceral** and **parietal** peritoneum.
### Alimentary Canal Nerve Plexuses
There are two intrinsic nerve plexuses that serve as a part of the [[ANPH/07|autonomic nervous system]]. They act to **regulate the mobility and secretory activity of the GIT organs**:
- **Submucosal Nerve Plexus**
- **Myenteric Nerve Plexus**
### Stomach
The **stomach** is a C-shaped organ on the left side of the abdominal cavity. It serves as a temporary storage tank for food, and where carbohydrate digestion continues. **Protein digestion also begins**. The stomach converts **bolus** into **chyme**, taking in food from the cardioesophageal sphincter and releasing it into the small intestines through the pyloric sphincter.
- **Cardial** (*cardia*): named because of its proximity to the heart.
- **Fundus**: the expanded portion lateral to the cardiac region.
- **Body**: the middle portion.
- **Greater Curvature**: the **convex lateral surface** of the stomach.
- **Lesser Curvature**: the **concave medial surface** of the stomach.
- **Pylorus**: the funnel-shaped terminal end of the stomach.
- **Rugae**: folds of the stomach, which allow for expansion of the stomach. The stomach can expand to hold around a gallon (4L) of food when full.
- **Omenta**: fused peritoneal folds that connect the stomach and duodenum with other abdominal organs. There are two omentum that attach to the stomach:
	- **Lesser Omentum**: the double-layer of the peritoneum, which extends from the liver to the lesser curvature of the stomach.
	- **Greater Omentum**: another extension of the peritoneum; a cover for the abdominal organs, with fat for insulation, cushioning, and protection. Connects the stomach and the transverse colon.
- **Stomach Mucosa**: the simple columnar epithelium composed almost entirely of mucous cells. The mucous cells produce bicarbonate-rich alkaline mucus.
	- **Gastric Pits** contain gastric glands that secrete gastric juice. This juice includes intrinsic factor (IF) that allows for the **absorption of Vitamin B12** (Cobalamin).
	- **Chief Cells** produce protein-digesting enzymes (pepsinogens)
	- **Parietal Cells** produce hydrochloric acid that activates enzymes.
	- **Mucous Neck Cells** produce thin acidic mucus (separate from the mucosal alkaline mucus)
	- **Enteroendocrine Cells** produce local hormones such as ***gastrin***.

### Small Intestines
The small intestines serve as **the main digestive and absorptive organ**. It is the longest by far, spanning from **2 to 4 meters in length** (up to 1.5 times in length after death). It **connects the pyloric sphincter and the small ileocecal valve** (beginning of the colon; large intestines). It is suspended from the posterior abdominal wall by the mesentery. **Enzymes break down chyme into its smallest form**, where it can be absorbed into the bloodstream. Enzymes are transported into the small intestines through:
- **Hepatopancreatic ampulla** is the location where the main **pancreatic duct** and **bile ducts** join.
- **Pancreatic Ducts**: intestinal cells and pancreas enzymes are carried to the duodenum.
- **Bile Duct**: bile, formed by the liver, into the duodenum.

The intestines are also covered in villi (finger-like projections) that increase the absorptive capabilities (surface area) of the intestines. Microvilli are smaller projections of the plasma membrane

#### Subdivisions of the Small Intestines
1. **Duodenum**, the starting C-shaped portion of the small intestines continuous with the pylorus (~30 cm long), which is where **enzymes are deposited from the liver and pancreas**. Carbohydrates and proteins are mainly absorbed in here and the jejunum.
2. **Jejunum**, the main site of lipid absorption.
3. **Ileum**, the largest portion of the small intestines, taking up the last ~3/5ths of the small intestines where it ends in the ileocecal canal, the beginning of the large intestines. It absorbs Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin), bile salts, and other undigested products. All segments work to absorb water and electrolytes.
