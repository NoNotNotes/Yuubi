>[!WARNING] This discussion is lifted from Ma'am Tuiza's presentation on Blood Transfusion (1 and 2). It will be supplemented with Kozier and Erb's Fundamentals of Nursing sometime soon.

A **Blood Transfusion** is the introduction of **whole blood** or other **blood components** into venous circulation. It is used to restore blood volume and the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood.

# Blood Groups
As many know, different individuals have different **blood groups**. Blood typing involves two different factors: the antigens present on the red blood cells (and antibodies present in the plasma), and the presence of a **rhesus** (Rh) **factor**.
>[!INFO] Antigens and Antibodies
>Antigens are **agglutinogens**, and are present on the surfaces of the red blood cells. They **dictate the blood type** of the individual. These may be A, B, AB, and (if both are absent), O.
>
>Antibodies are **agglutinins**, and are present in the plasma of an individual. They are normally the *inverse* of the antigens present in the blood. Otherwise, a rapid hemolytic reaction would occur, known as **ABO- Incompatibility**.

|                      | A         | B         | AB              | O                 |
| -------------------- | --------- | --------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| Antibodies in Plasma | Anti-B    | Anti-A    | None            | Anti-A and Anti-B |
| Antigens on RBC      | A antigen | B antigen | A and B antigen | None              |
| Can Transfuse From   | A, O      | B, O      | AB, A, B, O     | O                 |
| Can Transfuse To     | A, AB     | B, AB     | AB              | O, A, B, AB       |
- **O**: the universal donor
- **AB+**: the universal recipient

A **Rhesus** (Rh) **Factor** is another protein possibly found on the surface of red blood cells, as discovered by Karl Landsteiner and A.S. Weiner in 1940. They may be present (Rh+) or absent (Rh-). The being Rh positive or negative has no bearing on health, except in the case of an **Rh- mother bearing an Rh+ fetus**. The leakage of Rh+ fetal blood during delivery can result in the development of **Rh antibodies** by the mother, which can attack subsequent the red blood cells of Rh+ fetuses. This is known as an **Rh Incompatibility**.

>[!ERROR] Blood Typing and Crossmatching
>**Blood Typing** is done to determine the **ABO** blood group and **Rh Factor** status of an individual. This data is used to determine the blood transfusion options an individual has when the need for one arises.
>
>**Crossmatching** is a test to determine the possible interactions of **minor antigens** with their corresponding antibodies: **transfusion blood**, **recipient serum**, and **Coombs' serum** are all mixed to determine if **agglutination** will occur. If not, the risk of a transfusion reaction is small.

# Blood Donation
**Donors** are **not permitted** to donate blood if they have any of the following:
1. **Hepatitis B**, **Hepatitis C**, or **HIV**, or even just the risk factors for an HIV infection, disqualifies an individual from donation, as these can be transmitted by the blood.
2. **Heart Disease**
3. **Most types of cancer**
4. **Severe asthma**
5. **Bleeding disorders**, as venipuncture can result in excessive risk for the donor.
6. **Seizures**

Some more definitions can **defer** donation; these are conditions that have to abate before donation:
1. **Malaria**, or exposure to **malaria or hepatitis**.
2. **Anemia**
3. **Abnormal blood pressure**, both for high and low blood pressure
4. **Pregnancy**
5. **Recent surgery**
6. Some types of **medication**
7. **12 months after having a tattoo or piercing**
