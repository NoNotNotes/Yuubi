# The Effects of R.A. 1425
**Hernando Abaya** (1984) described it as a **nationalist reawakening** on the UP campus. The youth became aware of the contributions and principled life of Rizal, who became a role model. Through this Act, the essence of freedom, independence, and national identity was emphasized to the youth.

An argument was made for the compromisation of faith after the Act was passed. The UP Student Catholic Action and numerous other organizations went so far as to go against their president, Dr. Singco, due to "confusion between nationalism and faith", leading to a "godless" environment. The significance and relevance of Rizal was also weighed against the added workload of the students.

"Why Study Rizal?"
- It is mandated by law. 
- For the ideals, teachings, and application of such principles in the modern society and the self; to foster the youth in all aspects of citizenship.
- To gain a deeper appreciation and understanding of what Rizal fought and died for.
