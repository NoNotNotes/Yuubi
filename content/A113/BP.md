**Blood pressure** is the **pressure exerted by the blood** as it pulsates through the arteries. It is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) and is measured as two values: **systolic** (contractile) pressure and **diastolic** (relaxed) pressure:
1. **Systolic pressure** is the pressure of blood during contraction of the ventricles.
2. **Diastolic pressure** is the pressure of blood in between heartbeats; at rest.
3. **Pulse pressure** is the difference between diastolic and systolic pressure. This is normally 30 to 40 mm Hg.

>[!SUCCESS] Uses of Blood Pressure Assessment
>1. To **obtain a baseline measurement** of blood pressure for subsequent evaluation
>2. To **determine the client’s hemodynamic stability** (e.g., cardiac output; stroke volume of the heart and blood vessel resistance
>3. To **identify and monitor changes in blood pressure resulting from a disease process or medical therapy** (e.g., presence of history of CVD, renal disease, circulatory shock or acute pain, rapid infusion of fluids or blood products)

# Preparatory Phase
**Prepare the equipment**:
1. Find the **correct cuff size**: a narrow cuff will produce falsely high readings, and a wide cuff will produce falsely low readings. Bladder width should be at least 40% of the arm circumference, and length should cover 80% to 100% of the arm circumference.
2. Calibrate the **sphygmomanometer** if necessary.

**Assess the patient**:
1. **Look for signs of hypertension** (headache, ringing in the ears, a flushed face, epistaxis, fatigue) or **hypotension** (tachycardia, dizziness, mental confusion, restlessness, cool clammy and pale or cyanotic skin)
2. **Determine potential factors that can affect blood pressure** such as physical activity, stress, pain, and the ingestion of substances that can produce vasodilation or vasoconstriction (caffeine, nicotine)
3. **Identify potential latex allergies** and the presence of latex in the cuff used.

# Procedure
1. **Perform hand hygiene** and **observe appropriate infection prevention procedures**. This reduces the transfer of microorganisms between patients, especially for performing rounds of vital signs taking for a ward with one blood pressure apparatus.
2. **Prepare the required equipment**. Check for integrity and completeness of the equipment (leaks, damage, sizing, etc.).
3. **Introduce yourself** (if necessary) **and identify client identity** according to agency protocol.
4. **Inquire about recent ingestion of nicotine or caffeine 30 minutes prior to the measurement**, as these increase blood pressure by inciting vasoconstriction and increasing pulse rate. The patient should rest for at least five minutes before measurement.
5. **Explain the procedure** for patients new to the assessment. This will allay fears and promote cooperation with the nurse. Explain the actual procedure, its purposes, how the patient should cooperate, and what the results may be used for.
6. **Determine the appropriate extremity to perform assessment on**; extremities with intravascular infusion, blood transfusion, arteriovenous fistula, burns, trauma, casting, bandaging, or the arm on the side of a mastectomy or lymphadenectomy are all contraindications for blood pressure assessment.
7. **Prepare the client**: provide **privacy**, **position** the client (neutral position, **sitting** with both feet flat on floor) and the extremity (elbow slightly bent, palm facing up). The arm is placed at the level of the heart. Move sleeves or clothing out of the way of the placement for the cuff.
8. **Prepare the bladder cuff**: the cuff must be fully deflated and wrapped snug to the arm (only one or two fingers can be fit into the cuff when applied), positioned one inch (two fingerbreadths) above the antecubital space. This positioning ensures that the artery (**brachial artery**) is directly compressed by the bladder for an accurate reading.
9. **In initial examination**, perform a **palpatory determination of systolic pressure** to give an estimate of systolic pressure:
	- The brachial artery is palpated for a thrill
	- Inflate the cuff until a thrill is no longer palpable— this is the estimated systolic pressure.
	- Deflate the cuff. Further assessments should be done after one to two minutes.
