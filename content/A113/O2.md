**Oxygenation** is the delivery of oxygen to the body's tissues and cells for the maintenance of life and health. This depends on ventilation, alveolar gas exchange, oxygen transported, and cellular respirations.

# Respiration
**Respiration** is the transport of oxygen from the outside air to the cross within tissues, and the transport of carbon dioxide in the opposite direction. **Respiratory rate** (RR) is the number of breaths within a minute, and is monitored as one of the vital signs.
>[!WARNING] ABCs of Life Support
>All of the ABCs of Life are related to oxygenation. It stands for **Airway**, **Breathing**, and **Circulation**:
>1. **Airway**: patency is required to allow for ventilation. 
>2. **Breathing**: ventilation itself. 
>3. **Circulation**: pulse, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation, which is the internal transport of oxygen throughout the body. 

| Breathing Patterns               | Description                                                  |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Tachypnea**                    | RR>20                                                        |
| **Bradypnea**                    | RR<12                                                        |
| **Apnea**                        | Absence of breathing                                         |
| **Obstructive Sleep Apnea**      | Periods of apnea with irregular breathing                    |
| **Dyspnea**                      | "Shortness of breath"; difficulty breathing                  |
| **Paroxysmal Nocturnal Dyspnea** | Dyspnea causing wakening to catch one's breath               |
| **Air Hunger**                   | Acute dyspnea occurring in terminal stages of hemorrhage     |
| **Kussmaul's Breathing**         | Deep, sighing breathing                                      |
| **Cheyne-Stokes Respirations**   | Apnea alternating with slow, deep, then shallow respirations |
| **Orthopnea**                    | Dyspnea occurring when lying down                            |
| **Hyperventilation**             | Rapid, deep breathing                                        |
| **Hypoventilation**              | Slow, shallow breathing                                      |
## Nursing Considerations
A major nursing responsibility in respiration is **monitoring**. Changes in respiration can be observed by changes in skin color (cyanosis off the nail beds, lips,)
