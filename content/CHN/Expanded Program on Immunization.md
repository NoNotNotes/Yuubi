**Immunization** is an essential public health service and is commonly defined as the process of conferring artificial immunity to population groups. **Immunity** is described as resistance and protection from disease attributed to the presence of antibodies in the blood. The **National Immunization Program** (NIP) is committed to guaranteeing free immunization services and ensures that Filipinos, especially the poor, have access to routinely recommended vaccines. It further guarantees the immunization of **neonates**, **infants**, **children**, **adolescents**, **mothers**, and **elderly** populations as part of the comprehensive strategy for disease prevention and control following the life stage approach. Its goal is **to reduce morbidity and mortality** among infants and children caused by common childhood immunizable diseases. Specifically, the NIP has the following goals.
- To immunize all infants against vaccine preventable diseases
- To sustain polio-free status of the Philippines
- To eliminate measles infections
- To eliminate maternal and neonatal tetanus
- To control Diphtheria, Pertussis, Hepatitis B infection and German Measles (Rubella)
- To prevent extrapulmonary tuberculosis among children

Related laws:
- **PD No. 996** of 1976: providing compulsory basic immunization for infants and children below 8 years old
- **RA 7846** of 1994: inclusion of Hepatitis B immunization for infants and children below 8 years old
- **RA 10152** of 2011: Mandatory Infants and Children Health Immunization Act of 2011 for children up to 5 years of age and inclusion of new vaccines: **Hepatitis B**, **Mumps**, **Rubella**, and **Haemophilus Infuenza type B** (Hib). This repealed PD 996 and is considered the current legal basis of the NIP.
- **Presidential Proclamation No. 6** of 1996: Implementing a United Nations Goal on Universal Immunity by 1990; and **designating Wednesdays as Immunization day**.
## General Considerations for Implementation
1. Remind caregivers of children to comply with the prescribed schedule of routine immunization.
2. **Previous doses do not have to be repeated regardless of interval**.
3. The eligible age for **Pentavalent** vaccines is **up to 5 years old**.
4. Booster doses are not *really* necessary.
5. **Vaccines may be given on the same day, but in different sites**:
	- If through the same leg, space the site at least 2.5 to 5 centimeters (1 to 2 inches; at least two fingerbreadths).
	- **Start with OPV**, **then Rotavirus**, then the other vaccines.
6. Observe the "**First Expiry, First Out**" (FEFO) or "**First In, First Out**" (FIFO) principle in utilizing vaccine stocks.
7. Use **cotton** in cleaning the injection site. **If with alcohol, thoroughly dry before administrating the vaccine**.
8. **BCG, AMV, and MMR have special diluents**. After reconstitution, **these vaccines are only valid for 6 hours**. *This used to be 4 hours*
9. **Protect BCG from sunlight, and Rotavirus from light**. *This principle may be used in questions that ask which location is appropriate for vaccination*
10. Information caregivers of children for immunization about [[#Common Vaccination Side Effects and Management|common side effects]], and how to deal with it.
11. **Reusable vaccines** such as **OPV, Pentavalent, Hepatitis B, and Tetanus Toxoid** may last for a maximum of **4 weeks** as long as the vaccine has (a) not expired, (b) been maintained in appropriate cold chain conditions, (c) remained uncontaminated during aspiration, (d) a VVM that does not indicate discarding, and (e) the vaccine septum has not been submerged in water.

In cases of a **measles outbreak**, a **supplemental measles vaccine** is administered.
- For children **under 9 months old**, give **MR** (no vaccine for mumps) reconstituted with **two vials of special diluent** (6 mL total), giving 0.5 mL subcutaneously to the child.
- For children **9 months to 5 years old**, give **MMR**.

These are **NOT CONTRAINDICATIONS**:
1. **Fever up to 38.5°C** *"up to" means a fever of 38.5°C still permits vaccination.*
2. **Mild acute respiratory infection**
3. **Simple diarrhea**
4. **Malnutrition** *conversely, this is an indication; malnutrition poses greater risk for disease*
