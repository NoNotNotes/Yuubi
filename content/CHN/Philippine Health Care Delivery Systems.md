description: Exploring the various systems in place to provide all levels of care for the archipelagic country of the Philippines, and health goals of the various institutions related to public health.
---
The Philippines is an archipelagic country composed over ~7,100 islands. Geographically, it is divided into three main islands: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. Divided into 17 regions, 82 provinces, 135 cities, and 1,493 municipalities. The provision of health care for the country is divided into the private and public sectors.
- The **Private Sector** is responsible for the production and provision of health goods and services e.g. private clinics, hospitals, laboratories, drugstores, and other facilities.
- The **Public Sector** is a decentralized health care system managed by the Department of Health (DOH) and Local Government Units (LGUs).
	- Primarily funded by the government, private sources, and social health insurance. R.A. 7875 (The National Health Insurance Act) created PhilHealth, an insurance corporation exempt from tax attached to the DOH for policy coordination and guidance. PhilHealth aims for universal health coverage of all Filipinos.
	- An issue with funding remains prevalent. In 2018, the leading payment scheme remained **out-of-pocket** at around 40% to 50% of all health expenditures.

>- **Municipal or City Government Units** are in charge of [[PHC|Primary Health Care]], with RHUs and BHSs that plan and implement basic health services.
>- **Provincial Government Units** can provide a provincial or district hospital.

In a local government, the health board is headed by the governor or mayor, assisted by health officers and a health board that governs the health office, which is in charge of all unit providers of care (RHUs, BHSs, Provincial/District Hospitals, etc.)
