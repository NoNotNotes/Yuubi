A **Health Information System** (HIS) has four primary functions: data generation, compilation, analysis & synthesis, and communication & use. This system collects data from the healthcare and other pertinent sectors; analyzes gathered data; ensures overall data quality, relevance, and timeliness; and, converts the data into information imperative for health-related decision-making (WHO, 2008b).

The **Field Health Services Information System** (FHSIS) is the HIS utilized in the Philippine context, serving as the official reporting and recording system of the Philippine Department of Health (DOH). It is a facility-based and data-generated system from the Barangay Health Stations (BHS) and Rural Health Units (RHU) to the national level. The current FHSIS (version 2012) primarily aims to:
1. Provide raw and summary data on **health service delivery and selected health program accomplishment indicators**;
2. Provide a standardized, facility-level data base for **program monitoring and evaluation purposes**.
3. Provide more evidence-based data for **research purposes, policy formation and basis for health system interventions**; and
4. **Minimize documentation burden** at the service delivery level in order to allow more time for patient care and health promotion activities.

# Components of the FHSIS
There are two primary types of tools utilized by the FHSIS:
1. **Recording Tools**: detailed, **day-to-day**, facility-based **documents on the health services rendered to patients/clients** in the rural health facilities.
2. **Reporting Tools/Forms**: summary data transmitted or submitted on a **monthly**, **quarterly**, and **annual basis** to higher organizational levels of the healthcare delivery system. These are based on the Summary Table (ST) and Monthly Consolidation Table (MCT) recording tools.
## Recording Tools
1. **Individual Treatment Record** (ITR): the **primary building block** of the FHSIS. This is a basic patient consultation record containing a date, name, address of the patient, height, weight, chief complaint, presenting signs and symptoms, diagnosis (if available), and treatment. Examples of ITRs include *immunization records* or *national tuberculosis program treatment record*.
2. **Target Client List** (TCL): the **secondary building block** of the FHSIS. This is a list of eligible clients for a particular **health program**. It facilitates the **monitoring and supervision of service delivery activities** and **determines the client's compliance to a particular program**. Health programs to  be maintained under FHSIS version 2012 are: **Prenatal Care**, **Post-Partum Care**, **Nutrition and Expanded Program for Immunization**, **Family Planning**, and **Sick Children**. This tool provides a clinic-level data for population-based research.
3. **Summary Table** (ST): a form with 12 columns for a monthly tally of the number of clients in the barangay health facility in terms of **health program accomplishments** (all TCL data) and **morbidity diseases**.
4. **Monthly Consolidation Table** (MCT): a form filled up by the Public Health Nurse (PHN) to collate data report by all midwives of the city or municipality. It is essentially the **output table of the RHU**, consisting of the **reported data per indicator** by each Barangay Health Station or public health midwife. This record will serve as *the source document for the public health nurse for the Quarterly Forms*.
## Reporting Forms
*It will be important to memorize each report's alias!*
1. **Monthly Forms**:
	- **Program Report** (M1) contains selected indicators categorized as maternal care, childcare, family planning, and disease control; the same indicators found in the TCL and ST. This is report is submitted by the **midwife**.
	- **Morbidity Report** (M2) contains a list of all diseases by age and sex. This report is submitted by the **midwife**.
2. **Quarterly Forms**:
	- **Program Report** (Q1)
	- **Morbidity Report** (Q2)
3. **Annual Forms**:
	- Report on demographic, environmental, natality, and mortality. (A1)
	- Report on all diseases according to age and sex. (A2)
	- Report on all mortality cases or deaths according to age and sex. (A3)

# Standards of Documentation in Public Health
1. Contents of a medical record must meet all regulatory, accrediting, and professional organization standards. Some examples include nursing assessment and care provided; informed consent; teaching provided; response and reaction to teaching; etc.
2. Use **black permanent ink** for all entries.
3. Date, time, and sign all entries. Use first initial, last name and title.
4. Entries are to be **legible with no blank spaces left** on a line. If space is left on a line, draw a line through the space to the end of the line. Diagonal lines may be used for large spaces.
5. **Strikethrough errors** (~~*like this*~~), write `ERROR`, initial, and date the line. **Do not erase, obliterate, or "white out" the error**.
6. Entries are to be **factual, complete, accurate**, contain observations, clinical signs and symptoms, client quotes when applicable, nursing interventions, and patient reactions. Do not give opinions, make assumptions, or enter vague, meaningless statements e.g. "*is a good parent*". Be **specific**.
7. Use **correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation**.
8. Write the **client's name and other identifying information** on each medical record page.
9. Be sure to use **only those abbreviations approved by your agency/facility**.
10. **Always record a client's non-cooperative/non-compliant behavior**.
11. **Never document for someone else** or sign another nurse's name in any portion of the medical record.
12. **Documentation should occur immediately** after care given. Note problems as they occur, resolutions used and changes in client's status.
13. When leaving messages, document **time, name, and title of person taking message**, and telephone number you called.
14. **Record client assessment before and after** you administer medications or other treatments.
15. Document **any discussion of questionable medical orders**, and the directions the physician gave. Include the time and date of discussion and your actions as a result of the discussion and consequent directions given.
16. **Chart an omission as a new entry**. **Do not backdate** or add to previously written entries.
17. When an unusual incident occurs, **document the incident on a special incident or occurrence report form**. Do not write "incidence report" filed in the medical record. Do write what happened to the client and actions taken to assure the client's wellbeing in the medical record.
18. **Record only your own observations**, actions. If you receive information from another caregiver, **state the source of the information**.
19. Record the date, time, and content of **all telephone client-related communications**.
20. **If you did not document it, it did not occur**.
