The Department of Health issued **Administrative Order 2008-0029** entitled, "Implementing Health Reforms for the Rapid Reduction of Maternal and Neonatal Mortality" as a response to the slow decline in maternal and child mortality in the Philippines, far beyond the Millennium Development Goals in 2015. Interventions are made for each stage of life— prepregnancy, pregnancy, delivery, postpartum, newborn, and childcare— which will ensure the following results:
1. Every pregnancy is wanted, planned, and supported;
2. Every pregnancy is adequately managed throughout its course;
3. Every delivery is facility-based and managed by skilled birth attendants or skilled health professionals; and,
4. Every mother and newborn pair secures proper postpartum and newborn and childhood care.

In 2018, the challenges faced in the delivery of maternal and child health services include the following (DOH RPRH Report, 2018):
1. Low utilization of Family Planning Packages of PhilHealth. This low utilization may arise from confusion between patients and providers brought about by differing interpretations in the implementation of guidelines;
2. Decrease in the number of PhilHealth-accredited Maternal and Child Program (MCP) facilities;
3. Antenatal and postpartum care services lag; and,
4. Measles and polio outbreaks and increase in measles-related mortalities.
