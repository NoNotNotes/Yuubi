The Department of Health issued **Administrative Order 2008-0029** entitled, "Implementing Health Reforms for the Rapid Reduction of Maternal and Neonatal Mortality" as a response to the slow decline in maternal and child mortality in the Philippines, far beyond the Millennium Development Goals in 2015. Interventions are made for each stage of life— prepregnancy, pregnancy, delivery, postpartum, newborn, and childcare— which will ensure the following results:
1. Every pregnancy is wanted, planned, and supported;
2. Every pregnancy is adequately managed throughout its course;
3. Every delivery is facility-based and managed by skilled birth attendants or skilled health professionals; and,
4. Every mother and newborn pair secures proper postpartum and newborn and childhood care.

In 2018, the challenges faced in the delivery of maternal and child health services include the following (DOH RPRH Report, 2018):
1. Low utilization of Family Planning Packages of PhilHealth. This low utilization may arise from confusion between patients and providers brought about by differing interpretations in the implementation of guidelines;
2. Decrease in the number of PhilHealth-accredited Maternal and Child Program (MCP) facilities;
3. Antenatal and postpartum care services lag; and,
4. Measles and polio outbreaks and increase in measles-related mortalities.

# Safe Motherhood Program
The Philippines faces unique challenges in aligning its health system with the needs of its inhabitants, primarily because of the country's geography and income distribution. The DOH Women's Health and Safe Motherhood Project 2 (WHSMP2) aims to strengthen interventions with a priority on serving disadvantaged women. It is a fast-tracked system-wide reform in maternal health in selected provinces through a set of interventions:
1. **Sector governance**: improving accountability and regulatory oversight.
2. **Infrastructure and essential medical products and equipment**
3. **Human resource development**: clinical skill-building; formation of village-based women's health teams.
4. **Financing**: results-based financing mechanisms, insurance
5. **Service delivery**: availability, quantity, quality of health services

The National Safe Motherhood Program envisions that Filipino women have full access to health services to ensure safe pregnancy and delivery. It brought about a strategic change in the design of services provided, which includes:
1. Shift in handling pregnant clients from **risk approach** to **preparing all pregnant women for complications of childbirth**. It follows the principle of "*there is no low-risk pregnant woman*". Instead, all pregnant women are considered at-risk for pregnancy and childbirth complications. This brings about the establishment of the **BemONC-CemONC network**.
2. Improved quality of **Family Planning counselling** and expanded service availability of **postpartum family planning** in hospitals and primary birthing centers.
3. The **integration of cervical cancer, syphilis, hepatitis B, and HIV screening** among others into the antenatal care protocols.

## RMNCAHN Core Package Services
**Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child, and Adolescent Health and Nutrition** (RMNCAHN) core package services are health systems-oriented, multi-sectoral approaches in strengthening the continuum of care for women, children, families, and communities. The main objective is to enable all adolescents to make informed choices on reproductive health issues by creating awareness and providing access to information, education, support, services, and necessary treatments in the field of reproductive health. It covers the spectrum of **known appropriate clinical case management** services and known **cost-effective public health measures** to reduce risk.

These are the health providers that are part of the MNCHN Service Delivery Network:
1. **Community-level service providers** (Community Health Team; CHT) comprise of out-patient departments, barangay health stations, rural health units, and private clinics led by a midwife. These conduct health risks and needs assessment and provide basic service delivery functions such as birth spacing and counselling.
2. **BEmONC-capable Facility**, potentially barangay health stations, lying-in clinics, or birthing homes that provide parenteral administration of oxytocin (3rd stage), loading anticonvulsant, initial dose of antibiotic, assisted imminent breech deliveries, removal of retained products and placenta, and emergency newborn interventions (e.g., resuscitation, sepsis, and oxygen treatment). These facilities are **able to transfuse blood, if needed**.
3. **CEmONC-capable Facility**: a facility with all the capabilities of BEmONC facilities, with the addition of **cesarean section**, **blood banking**, highly specialized obstetric intervention, management of low birth weight and preterm babies, and other newborn specialized services. Intrauterine device insertion, vasectomy, and bilateral tubal ligation. A physician, nurse, and midwife are in charge for outreach services. One CEmONC facility caters to at least 500,000 population.

# Reproductive Health
**Reproductive health** is the state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of infirmity in all matters relating to reproductive system and to its functions and processes. It is based on the right to access appropriate health care services which enable women to go safely through pregnancy and childbirth and provides couples with the best chance of having a healthy infant (WHO, 2008). On the other hand, **reproductive health care** refers to the constellation of methods, techniques, and services which contribute to reproductive health and well-being by preventing and solving reproductive health problems (WHO, 2008).
## Legal Basis
1. **Republic Act No. 9710**: The Magna Carta of Women of 2009, "*the State shall, at all times, provide for a comprehensive, culture sensitive, and gender responsive health services and programs covering all stages of a woman's life cycle and which addresses the major causes of woman's morbidity and mortality*".
2. **Republic Act No. 10354**: The Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health (RPRH) Law of 2013 recognizes and guarantees the human rights to sustainable human development, health, education and information, and the right to choose and make decisions and in accordance with one's religious convictions, ethics, cultural beliefs, and demands of responsible parenthood.
## Responsible Parenthood
## Family Planning
A program which enables couples and individuals to decide freely and responsible the **number** and **spacing** of their children and to have the information and means to do so, and to have access to a full range of safe, affordable, effective, non-abortifacient modern natural and artificial methods of planning pregnancy (Congress  of the Philippines, 2012). This is enforced by **R.A. 10354**. It stands upon the **four pillars of family planning**:
1. **Responsible Parenthood**: the couple has the right to determine the **number of children** they want to have provided they can support the needs and provide better life to their children.
2. **Child Spacing**: a birth interval of **3 to 5 years** is encouraged. This also gives more time for the couple and other children to establish a strong relationship or bond.
3. **Respect for Life**: **abortion is considered illegal**, as protected by the 1987 constitution.
4. **Informed Choice**: the couple has the right to determine the kind of method in conformity with the universally recognized international human rights. The nurse is responsible for **fully informing** the couple regarding the options, advantages, and disadvantages of each method.

The mother is able to regain health after delivery, prevent pregnancy-related health risks, gives enough time for bonding with family and personal advancement, and enough time for treatment and recovery if ill. Infant mortality is reduced, healthy children start with healthy mothers, and children are able to receive attention, security, love and care that they deserve. The father also benefits, as the burden is lightened in supporting the family. He is then able to give his children their basic needs.

There are many methods of family planning. According to the WHO, contraceptives for family planning may either be modern or traditional. In most developing countries, limitations in modern methods may be due to limited choice of methods, access, fear or experience of side effects, cultural or religious opposition, poor availability. The following are contraceptive methods for family planning (WHO, 2018)
