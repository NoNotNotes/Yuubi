**Primary care** is the provision of interventions to cure specific conditions of individuals at the level of the community. It is the first level of healthcare delivery in which a generalist like a physician or a nurse renders medical and nursing services for individuals and population groups. It is often the first point of contact of patients in the healthcare system. **Primary Health Care**, in contrast, is an over-all approach to providing people **access to basic healthcare and ultimately improve health of communities**. It operates on three dimensions: a **goal**, a **strategy**, and a **philosophy**.
1. **Goal**: all people are provided access to basic health services, based on the declaration of health as a human right.
2. **Strategy**: it promotes collaboration among all sectors in society, valuing partnerships between public and private organizations.
3. **Philosophy**: it guides public health practitioners to rally communities to assume responsibility for the health.

PHC operates on the traditional cornerstones or pillars of **active community participation**, **inter- and intra-sectoral linkages**, the **use of appropriate technology**, and **available support systems**. They follow the **core values** of **social justice**, **equity**, **respect for human dignity and rights**, **solidarity**, and **self-reliance** in providing essential health services:
1. **Health education**, the primary role of public health nursing
2. **Immunization**
3. **Essential Medicines/Drugs**
4. **Mother and Child Health Services** (MNCHN)
5. **Endemic Disease Control and Management**
6. **Nutrition**
7. **Treatment of Simple Conditions**
8. **Sanitation and Access to Safe Water Supply**

# Elements of Primary Health Care
We've listed the three dimensions, four cornerstones, five core values, and eight health services from PHC. These are all considered in the three **elements** of PHC:
1. **Primary Care and Essential Public Health Functions** as the core of integrated services
2. **Multisectoral Policy and Action**: public health is a multidisciplinary science that revolves around prevention disease, prolonging life, and promoting health and efficiency of populations through collective efforts of all stakeholders.
3. **Empowered People and Communities**: this envisions health **in the hands of the people**, putting emphasis on health as a responsibility besides as a right. Health education and literacy can give people a sense of initiative, instilling a self-reliance in health.

# Determinants of Success
Four critical factors to "Health for all, by all" as outlined by The Astana Declaration (WHO, 2018a) include:
1. **Knowledge and Capacity Building**: information is an essential element of **self-sufficiency**. **Active participation** in planning and developing health programs and services aid in building capacity, fostering a **people-centered healthcare system**. Community organizing (e.g. COPAR) can also identify potential leaders as active partners of health agencies and professionals in promoting health and preventing disease.
2. **Human Resources for Health**: various skills and disciplines are required in community health. **Manpower is the most important resource in healthcare delivery**. This includes nurses, midwives, physicians, among other health professionals.

| Manpower              | Population Served |
| --------------------- | ----------------- |
| RHU/HC Physician      | 20,000            |
| Public Health Nurse   | 10,000            |
| Public Health Midwife | 5,000             |
| Public Health Dentist | 50,000            |
| RHU                   | 20,000            |
| BHS                   | 5,000             |
3. **Financing**: access to essential health services ultimately advance the well-being of the population, but **it entails cost and thus requires funding**. In 2018, the DOH reported that more than half of all health expenditures remain funded out-of-pocket (OOP); directly from the person receiving care. Sin taxes (R.A. 10351, R.A. 10963) are partially used for healthcare funding.
4. **Technology**: the provision of the highest possible level of **wellness requires the access to available services and technology**. Health professionals must employ and equip their practice with technologies to contribute to the goals of PHC. The WHO defines appropriate health technology as **effective**, **safe**, **affordable**, **sustainable**, and **acceptable**.

# Health Services
## Essential Drugs/Medicine
As mentioned earlier, the provision of **essential drugs/medicine** is part of PHC. These are used to treat endemic diseases, to reduce preventable deaths, and to improve health outcomes. Drugs are considered essential when they are life-saving but can also be used for all population groups. Examples of these include paracetamol and amoxicillin in primary care facilities for common problems like fever, headache, and infections
## Traditional and Alternative Care
**Republic Act 8423**, titled the **Traditional and Alternative Medicine Act** (TAMA)  institutes the Philippine Institute of Traditional and Alternative Health Care (PITAHC) under the DOH to improve the quality and delivery of health care services to the Filipino people through **the development of traditional and alternative health care** and its integration into the national health care. Today, these methods are called **T&CM**, **Traditional and Complementary Medicine**.
