**Andrology** is the study of the male reproductive system and urological problems. The primary reproductive function serves to produce and transport sperm through and out of the genital tract into the female genital tract. It is composed of the penis, scrotum, testes (testosterone, sperm), ducts (seminiferous tubules, epididymis, spermatic cord), accessory glands (seminal vesicles, prostate glands, Cowper's glands, urethra).

# The Penis
The penis is an elongated and cylindrical appendage, consisting of a body (shaft) and a cone-shaped end (glans). It lies in front of the scrotum. The penile root lies in the **perineum**, from where it passes forward below the symphysis pubis, while the lower two-thirds are outside the body in front of the scrotum and covered in skin. It is **extremely vascular**; blood spaces fill and become distended during sexual excitement, resulting in penile distention and stiffening, termed as an **erection**. The erectile tissue is composed of three columns, of two types:
1. **Corpora Cavernosa** (two columns): lateral columns located on either side and in front of the urethra
2. **Corpus Spongiosum** (one column): posterior column, which contains the urethra. The tip is expanded to form the glans penis. The skin at the end of the penis is folded back on itself above the glans penis to form the prepuce (foreskin), a movable double fold.

The penis is mainly attached and supported by the **suspensory ligament**, originating from the symphysis pubis and merging with the deep fascia of the penis. The blood supply of the penis is a parallel system of internal and external **pudendal arteries** and veins. Blood to the cavernous sinuses is provided by two branches of the **penile artery** (*the terminal end of the internal pudendal artery*).

The penis is innervated by the **pudendal nerve**. Sympathetic fibers come from the hypogastric and pelvic plexuses, while parasympathetic fibers come from the third and fourth sacral nerves. Stimulation of the parasympathetic causes contraction of the **ischiocavernous muscle**, which prevents the return of venous blood from the cavernous sinuses. The blood vessels engorge, and the penis becomes elongated, thickened, and stiff. If stimulation is intense, there is rhythmic contraction of the penile muscles, resulting in the forceful and sudden expulsion of semen, a phenomenon called **ejaculation**.
- Released with ejaculation is about **2 to 4 mL** (or 1.25 to 5 mL) **of semen** containing about **100 million sperm per mL**, of which about **20% to 25% are likely abnormal**; sperms move at a speed of 2 to 3 mm per minute. In a single ejaculation, the male deposits approximately 200 to 400 million spermatozoa in the vagina, of which fewer than 200 actually reach the ampulla.
- A successful sperm can fertilize an ovum in 5 to 30 minutes after ejaculation.
- Volume and force of ejaculate varies due to some factors:
	- **Age**: males tend to ejaculate the largest volume of semen in their thirties; decreases with age.
	- **Sexual activity**: decreased semen volume with recent sexual activity/masturbation reduces the distance semen can travel; increased semen volume than usual with prolonged periods of abstinence.
	- **Genetic factors**: some people naturally ejaculate more or less compared to others, regardless of health or lifestyle.
	- **Lifestyle factors**: diet, smoking, and other lifestyle factors can affect semen quality and overall health; regular exercise may improve fertility, sperm quality, and semen volume.
	- **Overall health**: injury, chronic illness, or surgery causing nerve damage may affect semen volume and quality.
	- **Certain drugs**: there are certain drugs that interfere with the production of sperm (anabolic drugs, testosterone, chemotherapy medication, opioids), antibiotic ketoconazole, and long-term use of antidepressant selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).
