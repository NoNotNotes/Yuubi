**Andrology** is the study of the male reproductive system and urological problems. The primary reproductive function serves to produce and transport sperm through and out of the genital tract into the female genital tract. It is composed of the penis, scrotum, testes (testosterone, sperm), ducts (seminiferous tubules, epididymis, spermatic cord), accessory glands (seminal vesicles, prostate glands, Cowper's glands, urethra).

# The Penis
The penis is an elongated and cylindrical appendage, consisting of a body (shaft) and a cone-shaped end (glans). Within it is the urethra, a passageway for both urine (excretory function) and semen (reproductive function, primary). It lies in front of the scrotum. The penile root lies in the **perineum**, from where it passes forward below the symphysis pubis, while the lower two-thirds are outside the body in front of the scrotum and covered in skin. It is **extremely vascular**; blood spaces fill and become distended during sexual excitement, resulting in penile distention and stiffening, termed as an **erection**. The erectile tissue is composed of three columns, of two types:
1. **Corpora Cavernosa** (two columns): lateral columns located on either side and in front of the urethra
2. **Corpus Spongiosum** (one column): posterior column, which contains the urethra. The tip is expanded to form the glans penis. The skin at the end of the penis is folded back on itself above the glans penis to form the prepuce (foreskin), a movable double fold.

The penis is mainly attached and supported by the **suspensory ligament**, originating from the symphysis pubis and merging with the deep fascia of the penis. The blood supply of the penis is a parallel system of internal and external **pudendal arteries** and veins. Blood to the cavernous sinuses is provided by two branches of the **penile artery** (*the terminal end of the internal pudendal artery*).

The penis is innervated by the **pudendal nerve**. Sympathetic fibers come from the hypogastric and pelvic plexuses, while parasympathetic fibers come from the third and fourth sacral nerves. Stimulation of the parasympathetic causes contraction of the **ischiocavernous muscle**, which prevents the return of venous blood from the cavernous sinuses. The blood vessels engorge, and the penis becomes elongated, thickened, and stiff. If stimulation is intense, there is rhythmic contraction of the penile muscles, resulting in the forceful and sudden expulsion of semen, a phenomenon called **ejaculation**.
- Released with ejaculation is about **2 to 4 mL** (or 1.25 to 5 mL) **of semen** containing about **100 million sperm per mL**, of which about **20% to 25% are likely abnormal**; sperms move at a speed of 2 to 3 mm per minute. In a single ejaculation, the male deposits approximately 200 to 400 million spermatozoa in the vagina, of which fewer than 200 actually reach the ampulla.
- A successful sperm can fertilize an ovum in 5 to 30 minutes after ejaculation.
- Volume and force of ejaculate varies due to some factors:
	- **Age**: males tend to ejaculate the largest volume of semen in their thirties; decreases with age.
	- **Sexual activity**: decreased semen volume with recent sexual activity/masturbation reduces the distance semen can travel; increased semen volume than usual with prolonged periods of abstinence.
	- **Genetic factors**: some people naturally ejaculate more or less compared to others, regardless of health or lifestyle.
	- **Lifestyle factors**: diet, smoking, and other lifestyle factors can affect semen quality and overall health; regular exercise may improve fertility, sperm quality, and semen volume.
	- **Overall health**: injury, chronic illness, or surgery causing nerve damage may affect semen volume and quality.
	- **Certain drugs**: there are certain drugs that interfere with the production of sperm (anabolic drugs, testosterone, chemotherapy medication, opioids), antibiotic ketoconazole, and long-term use of antidepressant selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).
## Special Concerns
1. **Impotence**/**Erectile Dysfunction**: the inability of the male to perform sexual intercourse due to absence or lack of ability to initiate and/or maintain erection. May be primary (though rare), or secondary (organic causes, e.g. diabetes, atherosclerosis, alcohol, drugs, psychogenic, injury).
	- **Treatment**: Viagra, Penile Prosthesis
2. **Ejaculatory Incompetence**/**Ejaculation Disorders**
	- **Premature Ejaculation**: ejaculation occurring before or very soon after penetration (the most common form of sexual dysfunction in men), or its counterpart, **Inhibited or Retarded Ejaculation**: when duration of stimulation required to reach climax is prolonged or climax cannot be reached.
		- Causes: often due to **performance anxiety**; lack of attraction for a partner; past trauma; drugs (antidepressants); psychological factors (strict religious background); and nerve damage to the spinal cord and back.
	- **Retrograde Ejaculation**: occurs when, at orgasm, the ejaculate is forced back into the bladder rather than the urethra and out the end of the penis.
		- Causes: problems with the nerves in the bladder and the bladder neck that permits ejaculate to flow into the bladder; diabetes/diabetic nephropathy; drugs/medications that treat mood disorders.
		- Treatment: generally does not require treatment unless fertility becomes impaired.
	- **Inability to Ejaculate Intravaginally**: potentially an emotional defense mechanism after the discovery of spousal infidelity or a subconscious refusal to become a father.
3. **Refractory Period**: the length of time/phase post-orgasm during which sexual response is diminished, and is unable to achieve another erection, orgasm, or ejaculation. This the hormones oxytocin, serotonin, prolactin, and dopamine.%%:
	- Oxytocin helps induce erections and ejaculation. The sudden surge of oxytocin during ejaculation stimulates the release of serotonin, the "feel-good" hormone.
	- Serotonin promotes feelings of sexual satisfaction, but its influence on the refractory period is still under debate.
	- Prolactin may also influence the male refractory period. High prolactin levels can interfere with the ability to achieve an erection until the levels eventually subside.
	- Dopamine, another "feel-good" hormone, helps facilitate ejaculation; after, it can also temporarily block the stimulation. This is especially true after an intense orgasm.%%
	- This period inhibits feelings of pleasure, or potentially even causes pain. Males may be unable to get an erection, orgasm, or ejaculate, even with sexual stimulation. This is a normal phenomenon and is not synonymous with incompetence.
	- The duration of this period can last for minutes to days, depending on age (shorter in younger men, longer in older man) and overall health. Other factors that affect its duration include mental health, medical conditions, sexual dysfunction, quality and frequency of sex, and routine exercise and engaging in sexual fantasy may indirectly influence the refractory rate by improving one's sexual fitness, self-image, and sex-drive (Myhre & Sifris, 2023)
## Phases of Sexual Response
(*mn. APOR, EPOR*)
1. **Arousal**/**Excitement**: the sexual stimulation by physical or mental stimuli such as touch, kissing, fantasizing, or viewing erotic images.
2. **Plateau**: the period of increasing sexual excitement during which the penis, vagina, and clitoris will engorge with blood and become highly sensitive.
3. **Orgasm**: the spontaneous release of sexual energy accompanied by rapid contractions of the lower pelvic muscles, including ejaculation.
4. **Resolution**: the gradual return to the normal level of functioning and swollen or erect body parts return to their normal sizes. This phase also includes refractory period.

# The Scrotum
The sac-like or pouch-like structure from the root of the penis, suspended from the perineal region. It contains the **testes** and **epididymis**, and primarily serves to maintain a lower temperature than the body (by ~1Â°C) to protect the testes and sperm, and promote spermatogenesis.
- The scrotum is formed of pigmented skin. It has two compartments, one for each testis. Dartos muscles in the scrotum contract to shorten or lengthen the distance of the testes from the body; related to the degree of wrinkling. Temperature affects the degree of wrinkling, e.g. the least wrinkling is found in older men at warmer temperatures, greatest wrinkling is found in young men at cold temperatures. Wrinkling in newborns depends on age. The scrotum is smooth in preterm babies, and wrinkled in full-term newborns.
- **Nursing Implication**: when educating for testicular self-examination (TSE), the best timing for checking is after a warm bath or shower when the scrotum is soft and less wrinkled, allowing for better palpation of the testes.
- **Nursing Implication**: in newborns, perform assessment of successful descent of the testes (palpation of the scrotum) from the abdominal cavity. Failure to do so will result in failure for spermatogenesis to occur.
___
# Testes
Two small (4.5 cm to 6 cm long, 2.5 cm wide, 3 cm thick), oval male gonads are suspended in the scrotum, weighing 10 to 15 grams. They are **covered by tunica vaginalis**, under which is the **tunica albuginea**, a tough, fibrous, white capsule that covers each testis. It sends inward projections that divide the testis into 250 to 400 lobules, which each contain one to three **convoluted seminiferous tubules** containing sperm cells in various stages of development.
- An additional inner layer of connective tissue which contains a fine network of capillaries is the **tunica vasculosa**, the innermost of the testicular covering layers.
