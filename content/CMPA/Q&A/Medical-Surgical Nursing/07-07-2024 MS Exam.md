A 65-year-old patient underwent an annual medical checkup. Which of the following is a risk factor for the development of coronary artery disease?
- [ ] Low levels of HDL cholesterol
- [ ] Low levels of LDL cholesterol
- [ ] Low concentration of triglycerides
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>Option 1 displays dyslipidemia. HDLs should be >40 mg/dL, LDLs should be <100 mg/dL, TG should be <150 mg/dL, and total cholesterol should be <200 mg/dL. All of these levels may be maintained by **exercise**.

A nurse receives emergency laboratory results for a client with chest pain and immediately informs the physician. An increased brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) suggests which of the following?
- [ ] Pericarditis
- [ ] Endocarditis
- [ ] Heart failure
- [ ] Myocardial damage
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>Heart failure increases the body's need to remove fluids due to congestion. BNP is one of the compensatory mechanisms. Pericarditis and endocarditis would fit with tests for ESR and CRP. Myocardial damage can reflect through Troponin I/T (best), CKMB, lactate dehydrogenase (last), and myoglobin (earliest).

For a 72-year-old client with edema in the leg and periorbital area, the most important nursing diagnosis is:
- [ ] Pain related to deteriorating health status
- [ ] Decreased fluid volume related to fluid retention and altered compensatory mechanisms
- [ ] Decreased ejection fraction related to reduced myocardial contractility
- [ ] Impaired airway clearance related to accumulation of secretions
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>The scenario indicates heart failure. Ejection fraction becomes decreased in heart failure from a deficiency in contractility. Edema is often the result of heart failure, liver failure, or kidney failure.

From an ECG reading, P waves represent:
- [ ] Ventricular depolarization
- [ ] End of ventricular depolarization
- [ ] Ventricular repolarization
- [ ] Atrial depolarization
