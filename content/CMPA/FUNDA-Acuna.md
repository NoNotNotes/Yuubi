Nursing, in contemporary times, is **a profession**. A profession is defined as a calling that requires special knowledge, skill, and preparation. Its primary characteristics include:
1. **Education**: the nurse provides health teaching
2. **Theory**: the nurse bases their actions on prefabricated theories and scientific knowledge.
3. **Service**: the nurse provides service with a caring attitude, regardless of compensation.
4. **Autonomy**: the independence of the nurse; the ability to exert judgments based on clinical expertise.
5. **Code of Ethics**: the nurse guides their actions with the promulgated code of ethics to ensure quality, safe, and ethical care.

# History of Nursing
1. **Intuitive Nursing** (up to the 6th century): this dates back to primitive tribes where nursing was done with intuition rather than knowledge. It is rooted in compassion, superstition, religion, and magic.
2. **Apprentice Nursing** (up to the 18th century): nursing starts to accumulate knowledge by way of schooling and apprenticeship. It was in this period that nursing schooling began, when Florence Nightingale became the most iconic nurse of all time. It may be considered as the golden age of nursing.
3. **Education Nursing**: began with the Florence Nightingale School of Nursing opened at St. Thomas Hospital in London; the first **formal education for nurses**. This gave way to the proliferation of other nursing schools.
4. **Contemporary Nursing**: present-day, professional nursing with the advent of modern machines and medical technologies.

# Patricia Benner's Novice to Expert Theory
As presented by Patricia Benner (1984), there are five stages of proficiency for skills, knowledge, abilities, and values of nursing:

| Stage                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Novice**            | Student nurses with no clinical experience                                                                                                                                       |
| **Advanced Beginner** | Marginally acceptable performance                                                                                                                                                |
| **Competent**         | Two to three years of experience; organizational ability, but lacking in speed and flexibility.                                                                                  |
| **Proficient**        | Holistic clinical eye with long-term planning. The nurse focuses on the client rather than specific tasks.                                                                       |

# Nursing Roles
1. **Care Provider**/**Parent Surrogate**: the role of the nurse concerned with **recognizing the patient's most immediate needs**.
2. **Communicator**/**Helper**: communicates with the client, supporting patients and colleagues. The end goal of communication is to **establish trust**.
3. **Teacher**: the nurse provides health education by first assessing the **learning needs** of a patient, **readiness** of the client, then the **actual provision of health teaching**.
4. **Counselor**: rather than providing **advice**, the nurse allows the patient to **explore and formulate responses to their problems**. The principal method used for this process is **active listening**; to offer the self and to let the client express their problems.
5. **Client Advocate**: the nurse advocates and upholds the client's rights.
6. **Change Agent**: the nurse initiates changes and assists the client in making **modifications in the lifestyle to promote health**, to help the patient speak up for themselves. An important patient goal is to **develop self-awareness**.
7. **Leader**: a mutual process of **interpersonal influence** through which the nurse helps a client make decisions in establishing and achieving goals to improve client's well being.
8. **Manager**: plans, give directions, develops staff, monitors operations, gives rewards fairly and represents both staff members and administration as needed.
9. **Researcher**: participates in scientific investigation and uses research findings in practice.
10. **Collaborator**: initiates nursing actions within the different disciplines of the health team such as physicians, dietitians, radiologists, respiratory therapists, etc.

# Focus of Nursing
1. **Health and Wellness Promotion**: developing resources to maintain or enhance their well-being
2. **Illness Prevention**: maintain optimal health by preventing disease.
3. **Health Restoration**: helping people in improving health following health problems or illness.
4. **Care of the Dying**: comforting and caring for people of all ages while they are dying.

In conducting nursing actions in conformance with the focus of nursing, there are **four major concepts** that a nurse must consider:
1. **Person**: the recipient of the nursing care
2. **Health**: the degree of wellness and well-being that a person experiences.
3. **Environment**: the internal and external surroundings that affects a person.
4. **Nursing**: attributes, characteristics, and actions of the nurse providing care in behalf of the client or in conjunction with the client.
## Person
Differing approaches provided varying perspectives to human beings as individuals:
1. **Atomistic Approach**: the man is an organism composed of organ systems, composed of organs, composed of tissues, composed of cells.
2. **Holistic Approach**: the man is a unit of a system of society with interrelated and interdependent parts that function to produce a behavior; the man is *more than the sum of his parts*. The dimensions of man include:
	- **Man as a Social Being**: an individual is able to relate with others; to socialize.
	- **Man as a Spiritual Being**: an individual is capable of virtues such as faith, hope, and charity. They believe in a power beyond themself.
	- **Man as a Thinking Being** are able to perception, cognition, and communication. They are capable of logical thinking and reasoning.
	- **Man as a Psychological Being** are able to be rational. This allows for mercy, kindness, and compassion.
	- **Man as a Physical Being** have such characteristics as genetic endowment, sex, and other physical attributes, structures, and functions.
## Hierarchy of Basic Human Needs
To preface, a **need** is some action, thing, or state that is essential to the survival of humans which, if absent, may lead to illness and, if fulfilled, can maintain or restore health. These needs are universal and interrelated, but may be deferred, may require stimulation from internal or external factors, and  may be met in different ways. The prioritization of needs may be altered, but in general they are sequentially necessitated as postulated by Abraham Maslow (see next section).

**Abraham Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs** is a sequential categorization of human needs, starting with:
1. **Physiological Needs** (Biological Needs): those needs essential for the survival of the human being, e.g. oxygen, fluids, nutrition, temperature, elimination, shelter, rest, sex.
2. **Safety and Security (Psychological) Needs**: **physical safety** (eliminate threats) and **psychological safety** (socialization; expectations of society).
3. **Love and Belongingness**: the need to establish social relationships and to experience emotional nurturance and care to and from others.
4. **Esteem and Self-Esteem Needs**: the desire for accomplishment, self-worth, strength, adequacy, competence, confidence, independence.
5. **Self-Actualization**: the achievement of known potential; these individuals are excellent problem-solvers and communicators. They handle stress, critique, and suggestions well. They enjoy privacy and appreciate their self. They are content.

## Health and Models of Health
**Health** is the fundamental right of every human being. It is a state of integration of the body and mind; a state of **complete physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease of infirmity** (WHO). Other definitions of health from notable persons:
- **Claude Bernard**: Health is the ability to maintain the internal milieu. Illness is the result of failure to maintain the internal environment.
- **Florence Nightingale**: Health is being well and using one's power to the fullest extent. Health is maintained through the prevention of diseases through environmental health factors.
- **Walter Cannon**: Health is the ability to maintain homeostasis or dynamic equilibrium.
- **Imogene King**: Health is a dynamic state in the life cycle. Illness is an interference in the life cycle.
- **Sister Callista Roy**: Health is a process of becoming integrated and whole as a person.

**Wellness** is a state of well-being. **Well-being** is a subjective perception of balance, harmony, and vitality. This appears in various dimensions:
1. **Physical**: ability to perform tasks of daily living and achieve fitness of the different organ systems of the body.
2. **Emotional**: stress-management and appropriate emotional expression.
3. **Social**: ability to successfully interact with others, develop societal values, and to develop and maintain intimacy with significant others.
4. **Intellectual**: learning and rational capability for personal, family, and career development
5. **Spiritual**: purpose and fulfilment found in the belief of a higher power.
6. **Occupational**: work-life/leisure balance.
### Ecological Model
**Leavell and Clark's Agent-Host-Environment Model**, simply known as the **Ecological Model** highlights three dynamic interactive elements that contribute to health and wellness:
1. **Agent**: any environmental factor or stressor whether biologic, chemical, mechanical, physical, or psychological, whose presence or absence can lead to illness or death.
2. **Host**: the person(s) who may be at risk of acquiring a disease based on family history of disease, lifestyle habits and age.
3. **Environment**: all factors external to the host that may predispose the person to the development of disease.
### Health Grid Model
**Dunn's Health Grid** is a health grid in which a health axis and an environmental axis intersect, which demonstrate the interaction of the environment with the illness-wellness continuum.
1. **High-level wellness in a favorable environment**. An example is a person who implements healthy lifestyle behaviors and has the biopsychosocial, spiritual, and economic resources to support this lifestyle.
2. **Emergent high-level wellness in an unfavorable environment**. An example is a woman who has the knowledge to implement healthy lifestyle practices but does not implement adequate selfcare practices because of family responsibilities, job demands, or other factors.
3. **Protected poor health in a favorable environment**. An example is an ill person (e.g., one with multiple fractures or severe hypertension) whose needs are met by the health care system and who has access to appropriate medications, diet, and health care instruction.
4. **Poor health in an unfavorable environment**. An example is a young child who is starving in a drought-stricken country.

![[dunn_high-level-wellness.png]]
### Health Belief Model
**Becker's Health Belief Model** (1975) describes the relationship between a person's **belief** and their **health-related behaviors**. It states that **individual perceptions** and **modifying factors** may influence health beliefs and preventive health behavior. These are the following:
1. **Individual Perceptions**: **perceived susceptibility, seriousness, or threat of an illness**; how much the person believes they may become sick, and to what degree the illness will affect them.
2. **Modifying Factors**: demographic variables, sociopsychologic variables, structural variables, and cues to action.
### Illness-Wellness Continuum
**Travis' Illness-Wellness Continuum** is a model that plots illness and wellness on a continuous axis rather than as distinct, discrete states of health. From the neutral point, moving to the right indicates health and well-being, and moving to the left indicates a decreasing state of health.
![[travis_illness-wellness-continuum.png]]
### Smith's Model of Health
**Smith** (1981) proposed multiple views of health organized into four distinct models to provide a holistic view on health of an individual:
1. **The Clinical Model** defines health as the *absence of any disease*
2. **The Role-Performance Model** describes health as the *competent performance of socially defined roles*
3. **The Adaptive Model** characterizes health as a *flexible adjustment* to changing life situation; the individual is able to interact with the physical and social environment.
4. **The Eudemonistic Model** views health as exuberant wellbeing; health is a condition of *actualization* or realization of one's potential.
## Disease and Illness
**Disease** is the alteration of functioning which results in the reduction of capacities and shortening of lifespan. **Illness** is a *personal state* in which the person themself feels unhealthy. Edward Suchman (1972) identified **five stages of illness behavior**:
1. **Stage 1: Symptom Experience**; the person begins to believe that something is wrong. This involves three aspectsâ **physical** (fever, aching, malaise), **cognitive** (perception of the presence of illness), and **emotional** (stress and anxiety over illness)
2. **Stage 2: Assumption of the Sick Role**: the persistence and progression of symptoms push clients to assume a sick role; a social phenomenon where individuals seek confirmation from social groups (family, friends) that they are ill and become exempted from normal duties and roles
3. **Stage 3: Medical Care Contact**: after home remedies fail to remedy symptoms or they progress to a severe condition, individuals are motivated to seek professional health services. A real illness is validated, symptoms are explained, and outcomes are defined (reassurance or prediction).
4. **Stage 4: Dependent Client** Role: the client depends on health care professionals for the relief of symptoms. Dependence makes the individual more passive and accepting.
5. **Stage 5: Recovery/Rehabilitation**: the correction of symptoms, or adjustment to prolonged reduction in health and functioning in chronic illness.

Diseases may be classified depending on their nature:
1. **Etiology**:
	- **Hereditary**: defects in the genes of ascendants transmitted to the offspring.
	- **Congenital**: defects in development potentially due to hereditary factors or teratogenesis.
	- **Metabolic**: disturbances or abnormality in the metabolic systems of the body
	- **Deficiency**: inadequate intake or absorption of essential dietary factors
	- **Traumatic**: injury
	- **Allergic**: hypersensitivity to physical or chemical stimuli.
	- **Neoplastic**: abnormal or uncontrolled growth of cells
	- **Idiopathic**: with an unknown cause, often self-originated and spontaneous
	- **Degenerative**: degeneration of tissues and organs
	- **Iatrogenic**: complications of treatment
2. **Presentation**:
	- **Organic**: diseases that result from physical changes in tissues or organs.
	- **Functional**: diseases that occur without observable structural changes in tissues or organs; affects *function* rather than anatomy.
	- **Occupational**: diseases resulting from exposure to hazards in the workplace environment.
	- **Venereal**: diseases from sexually transmitted infections
	- **Familial**: diseases running in families either due to genetic factors, lifestyle factors, or environmental factors.
3. **Epidemiology**:
	- **Epidemic**: a large number of individuals are affected at the same time.
	- **Endemic**: a community that displays the presence of a disease continuously.
	- **Pandemic**: an extremely widespread occurrence of disease spanning countries or continents.
	- **Sporadic**: a disease with occasional cases not limited to one region.

>[!WARNING] General Risk Factors of Disease
>1. **Genetic or Physiologic Predisposition**
>2. **Age**
>3. **Environment**
>4. **Lifestyle** such as a sedentary lifestyle, substance use or abuse, etc.
>5. **Sex**
## Levels of Prevention
1. **Primary Prevention**: used in healthy individuals for the prevention of disease by reducing risk factors. This mainly comes in the form of **health teaching**.
2. **Secondary Prevention**: used in potentially sick individuals (with S/S) for the early detection of disease. This mainly comes in the form of **screening** and **testing**.
3. **Tertiary Prevention**: used in patients with disease (chronic, debilitative). The primary focus is on **rehabilitation**.
