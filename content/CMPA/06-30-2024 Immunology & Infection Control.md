# Immunoglobulins
1. **IgG**: the most abundant immunoglobulin; able to cross the placenta. It is found in chronic infection.
2. **IgA**: found in secretions and is 
3. **IgM**: the largest immunoglobulin, found to rise during acute infections.
4. **IgE**: allerges; responsible for pruritus/urticaria, and helminths.
5. **IgD**: no role
# Asepsis
1. **Medical Asepsis**: the use of barriers (PPE), hand hygiene, and environmental cleaning to minimize microorganisms.
2. **Surgical Asepsis**: cleaning of the sterile field to isolate the operative area from the unsterile environment to avert contamination of open wounds.
# Food & Water-borne Illness
Food and water-borne infections, (mn. Take Care Po, HA!)
- Typhoid
- Cholera
- Polio
- Hepatitis A and E
- Amoebiasis
# Lines of Defense
## First Line of Defense
"Natural immunity" provided by:
1. **Intact skin and mucous membranes**
2. **Enzymes** in tears and body secretions
3. **Normal flora** of the body
## Second Line of Defense
Also natural immunity, the defensive immune cells of the body:
1. **Neutrophils**, Eosinophils, Basophils
2. **Macrophages**
3. **Natural Killer** (NK) **Cells**: killers of virus and bacterial-infection cells.
## Third Line of Defense
Acquired immunity; B-cells and T-cells. They mature in the bone marrow and thymus; these are the primary lymphoid organs. Secondary lymphoid organs include the appendix, spleen, and tonsils. They produce immunoglobulins and antibodies.
1. B cells remain in the bone marrow to reach maturity. They differentiate to become antibody-producing plasma cells, produces antibodies and immunoglobulins, and are antigen producing cells.
2. T cells migrate into the thymus to mature. They are composed of CD4 (Helper) T-cells and CD8 (Cytotoxic) T-cells.
	- CD4: . These are the cells destroyed in AIDS, and is monitored for patients with AIDS.
	- CD8

Immunity can be passive or active, and also natural or artificial.
## Antibodies
Antibodies react with antigens. Antigens stimulate the production of antibodies.
# Infection Control
**Disinfection and sterilization** both destroy microbes in non-living items. Distinctively, sterilization includes the destruction of gram-positive bacilli. Disinfection does not eliminate spores. For the destruction of microorganisms on living tissue, the action is termed as **Antisepsis**.
## Chain of Infection
The chain of infection starts with a (1) microorganism, in a (2) reservoir, that exits through the (3) portal of exit, travels via the (4) mode of transmission, then enters the (5) portal of entry into a (6) host, the most important aspect of this chain.
- The easiest aspect to break in this chain is the **mode of transmission**.
## Aerosol-Generating Procedures (AGP)
These procedures require the use of **N95 masks**, which protect against aerosols. (mn. BASIC)
1. **Bronchoscopy**
2. **Airway Suctioning**
3. **Sputum Induction**
4. **Intubation and Extubation**
5. **PR, Ventilation** (Manual, non-invasive bipap., CPAP)
## Medical Wastes
Waste produced during the course of care and are contaminated or visibly soiled:
- Blood or other potentially infectious materials
- Urine, feces, suctioned fluids
- Irrigating solutions, excretions, and secretions

A color-coding scheme is used for medical waste management:
1. **Red Container**: sharps
2. **Green Container**: non-infectious wet waste
3. **Black Container**: non-infectious dry waste
4. **Yellow Container**: infectious waste
5. **Orange Containers**: radioactive waste
## Hospital Infection Control Committee
1. **Chief of Hospital**
2. **Infection Control Doctor**
3. **Infection Control Nurse**
## Infection Control Basics
This includes sterilization, environmental care, healthcare waste management, and healthcare worker protection, etc.
1. **Hand Hygiene**
2. **Isolation Procedure**: the separation of agents to prevent contamination.
3. **Decontamination**: the removal of moist body substances from items before cleaning and disassembly.
4. **Disinfection**: the use of chemical agents. Spores are not destroyed.
