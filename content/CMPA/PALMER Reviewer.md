# Professional Adjustment and Nursing Practice
>[!NOTE]
>Most of the following information is based on R.A. 9173, the **Philippine Nursing Act of 2002** as presented in Atty. Luansing's book.

A **Profession** is a calling requiring specialized knowledge and intensive academic preparations. In nursing, it is the performance, for a fee or a salary, of professional services e.g. responsible nursing care, observation of symptoms, accurate reporting and documentation, supervision of others, execution of nursing procedures, and execution of valid doctor's orders. There are **seven specific characteristics of a professional nurse**:
1. **Accountability**: the nurse is accountable for their actions.
2. **Autonomy**: the nurse is able to think independently and take actions related to patient care within their scope of practice.
3. **Altruism**: the nurse is selfless and services others without regard for compensation or reward.
4. **Caring Attitude**: the nurse puts in diligent efforts to care for any client, sick or well, and regardless of the patient's economic or social status.
5. **Competency**: the nurse is competent in all of their duties, and continues professional training to keep up with changes in patient care. The nurse should be able to recognize when they are not qualified for their duties and act accordingly.
	- R.A. 10912, The **Continuing Professional Development** (CPD) Act of 2017 for nursing mandates 15 credit units for professional license renewal, in this case every 3 years. These are obtained from formal learning, non-formal learning, informal learning, self-directed learning, online learning activities, and professional work experience.
6. **Ethical**: the nurse follows the nursing [[#code of ethics]] and is equipped with the morality of human conduct, values, and standards.
7. **Service-Oriented**: the nurse is dedicated to service, in that they are able to anticipate, recognize, and meet the patients' needs.
8. **Specialized**: the nursing profession requires a specialized body of knowledge and well-defined skills.
## Scope of Nursing Practice
The scope of nursing practice is defined under Section 28, Article VI of the Philippine Nursing Act of 2002. A person is said to practice nursing when they render nursing services to other individuals or groups from womb to tomb. Nursing services include but are not limited to:

- (2) collaborate with communal resources and health teams

- (5) undertake nursing and health human resource development, training, and research.
## Roles of a Professional Nurse

2. **Change Agent**: to initiate or assist in **changing the patient's condition or lifestyle, or the systems of care** via Kurt Lewis' **Unfreeze, Change, Refreeze** theory
3. **Counselor**: helping the client **recognize and cope with psychologic or social problems**, develop an improved interpersonal relationship, **promote personal growth**, develop new or alternate attitudes, feelings, and behaviors, **recognizing health choices**, and developing a sense of control.
4. **Teacher**: **provide information** regarding health, help the client learn or **acquire new knowledge and skills**, and encourage adherence to treatment and healthy lifestyles.
5. **Researcher**: participate in **identifying significant researchable problems** and using the research process for **investigation**.
