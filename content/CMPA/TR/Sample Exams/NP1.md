1. In response to above trends, the global community, represented by the Nations General Assembly, decided to adopt a common vision of poverty reduction and sustainable development in September 2000. This vision is exemplified by the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) which are based on the fundamental values of freedom, equality, solidarity, tolerance, health, respect for nature, and shared responsibility. Which among these is not a Millennium Development Goal?
- [ ] Improve maternal health
- [ ] Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases

3. According to C. E. Winslow, “Public health is the science and art of (1) preventing disease, (2) prolonging life, and (3) promoting health and efficiency through organized community effort.” Which is considered as the key phrase definition of public health?
- [ ] development of the social machinery to ensure everyone a standard of living adequate for the maintenance of health
- [ ] through organized community effort
- [ ] organization of medical and nursing services for the early diagnosis and preventive treatment of disease
- [ ] education of the individual in personal hygiene
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>"*through organized community effort*"; public health is not done by a governing body alone, but through all aspects of the community.

4. Public health nursing is strongly built on theories of health promotion and disease prevention. This model found that information alone is rarely enough to motivate people to act for their health. Individuals must know what to do and how to do it before they can take action.
- [ ] Health Belief Model
- [ ] Health Promotion Model
- [ ] Social Learning theory
- [ ] General Systems Theory
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>The health belief model states that health-related behaviors are based on individual perceptions on their severity and susceptibility to potential disease, and the benefits of changing behavior to prevent or reduce the effect of illness, i.e., knowledge of disease alone is not sufficient to alter behavior. The individual must perceive a threat to their own health, and believe a specific health action will be beneficial in reducing the threat.

5. It is based on the assumption that behavior change takes place over time, and progresses through stages. Each stage is stable and is open to change; meaning one may stop in one stage, progress to the next stage or return to a previous stage.
- [ ] General Systems Theory
- [ ] Transtheoretical Model
- [ ] PRECEDE-PROCEED Model
- [ ] Milo’s Framework for Prevention
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>The Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change, also known as the Stages of Change model, describes the stages of changes in behavior: precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, maintenance, and termination. It recognizes that behavior change is a process that individuals go through over time.

16. This vital statistics indicate the natural decrease in population.
- [ ] Crude birth rate
- [ ] Crude death rate
- [ ] Prevalence Rate
- [ ] Incidence rate
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>The Crude Death Rate indicates the rate at which members of the population decreases. It measures death as deaths in a portion of the population (e.g., 1,000) over a time period (e.g., one year). For example, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) reports a crude death rate of 6.1 for every 1,000 population in 2022.
>- Crude Birth Rate depicts the same presented above, but for births; it is the total number of live births in a year divided by the population size multiplied by 1,000 (to scale to every 1,000 population).
>- Prevalence rate has to do with the number of cases for a certain disease, including all historical cases.
>- Incidence rate has to do with the number of **new** cases for a certain disease over a given time period.

17. Nurse Caloy wants to determine the health status of a population and infer their longevity of life and lifestyle by using statistics. What vital statistics shall he use?
- [ ] Prevalence Rate
- [ ] Swaroop’s Index
- [ ] Maternal Pregnancy Rate

>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>Community health status is often indicated by the infant mortality rate.

19. This is also known as the index of pregnancy wastage.
- [ ] Fetal death rate
- [ ] Neonatal mortality rate
- [ ] Infant mortality rate
- [ ] Mortality rate
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>Fetal death rate includes abortions, miscarriages, and stillborns.

20. Retrieving this number, this will help direct the efforts to improve maternal post partum care in the community. This also shows that an improvement in environmental factors must be promoted to improve the numbers.
- [ ] Fetal death rate
- [ ] Neonatal mortality rate
- [ ] Infant mortality rate
- [ ] Mortality rate
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>Neonatal mortality rate is the number of deaths of newborns within 28 days of age. It reflects maternal postpartum care and environmental status of the community. It is measured as the number of neonatal deaths for every 1,000 live births.

>[!INFO] Situation
>In Community Health Nursing, the community is not simply a context of the existence of the nurse’s clients nor is it just a setting for our nursing interventions. Spradley (1990) emphasizes that the community is the primary client for two main reasons. First, the community has a direct influence on the health of the individual, families, and sub-populations. Second, it is the level that most health service provision occurs. 

21. According to Freeman and Heinrich, community health diagnosis is based on three interdependent, interacting and constantly changing conditions. Which of these is not included?

>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>Diversity is not included as an interdependent, interacting and constantly changing condition in a community health diagnosis.

22. Collecting data is important in community assessment. There are different methods as to how one can obtain data. Which method is used to elicit and explore opinions of people, determine their attitudes and practices regarding limited set of concepts? Participants selected should have characteristics that will be common to them, and characteristics that will also differentiate them from one another.
- [ ] Group interviews
- [ ] Key Informant Interviews
- [ ] Focus Group Discussions
- [ ] Windshield Survey
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>The described assessment process is a focus group discussion. Group interviews lack the exploration of opinions of people. Key Informant Interviews utilize experts or well-positioned members of the community, and Windshield Surveys are ocular surveys of the status of the community.

23. You wanted to be as comprehensive as possible in identifying different problems in the community. You have identified that the RHU is having difficulty in providing services to their population coverage. Further assessment shows that there are a lot of plantilla positions left unfilled. What kind of problem is this?
- [ ] Health status problem
- [ ] Health resources problem
- [ ] Health-related problem
- [ ] Health concern problem
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>When concerned with institutions, manpower, materials, and money necessary for solving health problems. The problem discussed is a **Health resources problem**.

24. You have also observed that the local government does not make health as their priority thus leaving their BHCs and RHUs lacking of resources and manpower. There is also a lack health program implementation as no support is received. This is classified as:
- [ ] Health status problem
- [ ] Health resources problem
- [ ] Health-related problem
- [ ] Health concern problem
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>While mentioning resources and manpower, the root problem lies in politics, and is therefore a **Health-related problem**. These types of problems are described in terms of social, economic, environmental, and political factors that aggravate illness-inducing situations in the community.

25. Reviewing the records, you found out that there is an increasing number of non-communicable diseases in the barangay. You classify this problem as?

>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>Increases in morbidity and mortality or decreases in fertility and capability for wellness all fall under **health status problems**.

>[!INFO] Situation
> Nurse Jessa attempts to identify the possible factors associated with the increasing cases of malnutrition in Brgy. Hintuturo. 

26. She attempts to derive the risk of an individual developing a disease due to a particular exposure by comparing the occurrence of a disease in a population exposed to the suspected factor. She wants to use an estimate which is the direct measure of strength of association between a suspected cause and effect. Her existing data includes the incidence rates of those who had who were exposed and incidence rate among those who are not exposed. Which risk estimate shall she use?
- [ ] Odds Ratio
- [ ] Attributable Risk
- [ ] Incidental Risk Ratio
- [ ] Relative Risk
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
> [Reference](https://www.nwcphp.org/docs/risk/risk_transcript.pdf) Relative risk (RR) should be used for data sets of two groups: those exposed, and those not exposed. It estimates the causal relationship between an exposure and an outcome; the higher the relative risk, the stronger the relationship between exposure and outcome. It is calculated as the ratio of incidence in exposed populations and incidence non-exposed populations.
>- The Odds Ratio is an alternative to RR when data for incidence is not available, and are calculated from case-control studies. These determine the "*odds*" of a certain criteria increasing the incidence of a particular outcome.
>- Attributable Risk is the amount of risk which can be directly attributed to a criterion, e.g., all cases of lung cancer death rate subtracted by the lung cancer death rate of non-smokers returns the lung cancer death rate of smokers, which is theoretically the amount that can be reduced if smoking ceases.
>- Incidental Risk Ratio (IRR) is the same as RR, but utilizes **incidence density** rather than cumulative incidence.

27. Using the PRECEDE-PROCEED model, she is also aiming to identify the contributing factors of a problem that may become the focus of subsequent intervention. These are characteristics of the client that motivates behavior related to health, and it can be described in terms of client’s knowledge, attitudes, values and perceptions.
- [ ] Predisposing factors
- [ ] Internal factors
- [ ] Enabling factors
- [ ] Reinforcing factors
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
> [Reference](https://ctb.ku.edu/en/table-contents/overview/other-models-promoting-community-health-and-development/preceder-proceder/main) The described characteristics are predisposing factors.
>- "Internal factors" is not a recognized term.
>- Enabling factors are factors that allow for the health behavior to occur, e.g., the presence of multiple fast-food joints in the community.
>- Reinforcing factors are strengthening (positive) or weakening (negative) consequences of certain health behaviors.

28. These are considered the factors which can be rewards or punishments following or anticipated as a consequence of a health behavior.
- [ ] Predisposing factors
- [ ] Internal factors

- [ ] Process evaluation
- [ ] Impact evaluation
- [ ] Structure evaluation
- [ ] Outcome evaluation
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>Impact evaluation evaluates the short-term objectives; the immediate effects of the program.
>- Process evaluation evaluates the activities of the program, and quality of its reach (coverage).
>- Outcome evaluation evaluates the long-term goals/the overall goal of the program.

30. In evaluating programs, we use indicators to identify which factors should be achieved and resolved by the community.

Which indicator shows to what extent something that has been made available is actually being used for that purpose?
- [ ] Relevance
- [ ] Coverage
- [ ] Efficiency
- [ ] Utilization
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>Utilization is the degree to which an available resource is being used. Relevance is the significance of the resource in the community. Coverage is the amount of the target population is actually covered by the resource. Efficiency is the degree to which the resource fulfills its intended purpose.

>[!INFO] Situation 
>Nurse Dan is handling patients with respiratory problems. Tommy has been diagnosed with ineffective airway clearance due to excessive secretions and is at risk of infection from these retained secretions. As part of Nurse Dan’s care plan, the goal is to loosen and remove these excessive secretions from Tommy’s airway.

31. After listening to Tommy’s lung sounds, Nurse Dan identifies congestion in the upper lobes. To drain the anterior and posterior apical segments of the lungs during percussion, the correct position would be:
- [ ] Client lying on his back, then flat on his abdomen in the Trendelenburg position
- [ ] Client seated upright in bed or on a chair, then leaning forward while sitting, then flat on his back and abdomen
- [ ] Client lying flat on his back, then flat on his abdomen
- [ ] Client lying on his right side, then left side in the Trendelenburg position
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
> The apical segments are the top-most regions of the lungs. To allow gravity to aid in draining the secretions, the position to utilize is with the client seated upright in a bed, then leaning forward, then flat on his back and abdomen.

32. When documenting the results of Tommy’s treatment, Nurse Dan should include the following details EXCEPT:
- [ ] Color, amount, and consistency of sputum
- [ ] Character of breath sounds and respiratory rate before and after the procedure
- [ ] Amount of fluid intake before and after the procedure
- [ ] Significant changes in vital signs
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>While fluid intake is important for reducing the viscosity of secretions, it is not an essential part of the documentation process.

33. When evaluating Tommy for chest percussion, vibration, and postural drainage, Nurse Dan should concentrate on the following EXCEPT:
- [ ] Amount of food and fluid consumed during the last meal before treatment
- [ ] Respiratory rate, breath sounds, and location of congestion
- [ ] Instructing the client’s relatives on how to perform the procedure
- [ ] Doctor’s orders regarding position restrictions and the client’s ability to tolerate lying flat
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>It is not a priority to instruct the relatives on performing chest physiotherapy. The food and fluid consumed during the last meal before the procedure is important for avoiding aspiration, improving comfort, tolerance, and effectiveness (fluids reduce secretion viscosity).

34. When preparing Tommy for postural drainage and percussion, which of the following is a special consideration?
- [ ] Respiratory rate of 16 to 20 per minute
- [ ] Client’s ability to tolerate sitting and lying positions
- [ ] Absence of signs of infection
- [ ] Time of the client’s last food and fluid intake
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>It is important to assess the client's ability to tolerate sitting and lying positions. Pain or discomfort, or other reasons to contraindicate positions should be noted before the procedure. The respiratory rate and absence of the signs of infection are normal findings, and last food and fluid intake is not a *special* consideration.

35. The purpose of chest percussion and vibration is to loosen lung secretions. The difference between these procedures is:
- [ ] Percussion uses only one hand, while vibration uses both hands
- [ ] Percussion delivers cushioned blows to the chest with cupped palms, while vibration gently shakes secretions loose during the exhalation cycle
- [ ] In both percussion and vibration, the hands are placed on top of each other and move in sync with the client’s breathing rhythm
- [ ] Percussion slaps the chest to loosen secretions, while vibration shakes the secretions during inhalation
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>Percussion uses cupped palms to physically dislodge secretions. Vibration gently shakes secretions loose during exhalation.

>[!INFO] Situation 
>Nurse Angel is doing her rounds in the ward, when someone called a code. She rushed immediately to the bedside.

36. Nurse Angel grabs the defibrillator and rush to the room where resuscitation is in progress. A colleague has started CPR and confirms the patient is in ventricular tachycardia. As she begins to attach the AED, she notices a transdermal medication patch on the victim's upper right chest, exactly where she needs to place an AED electrode pad. What is the most appropriate action?
- [ ] Ignore medication patch and place the electrode pad in the standard position
- [ ] Avoid medication patch and place second electrode pad on victim’s back
- [ ] Remove the medication patch, wipe the area dry, and place the electrode pad in correct position
- [ ] Place electrode pad on the victim’s right abdomen
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>Remove the medication patch and wipe the area dry. Using other placements or not removing the medication patch will reduce the electrode's ability to deliver a shock.

37. It is important for her to recognize which rhythms are for cardioversion, defibrillation or non-shockable. Which among the following is non-shockable?
- [ ] Ventricular fibrillation
- [ ] Ventricular tachycardia
- [ ] Asystole
- [ ] Pulseless ventricular tachycardia
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>The only non-shockable rhythms are Asystole and Pulseless Electrical Activity (PEA). Defibrillation shocks the heart's rhythm back into normal rhythm.
>- In asystole, no electrical activity exists, meaning there are no impulses to reset or synchronize.
>- In PEA, electrical activity persists, but the underlying problem lies in the mechanical ability of the heart, and not the electrical activity of the heart, meaning defibrillation would not correct its pumping ability.

38. This is considered as the most important intervention for VF/ pulseless VT with the greatest effect on survival to hospital discharge?
- [ ] Epinephrine
- [ ] Defibrillation
- [ ] Oxygen
- [ ] Amiodarone

39. Which of the following is the most important step to restore oxygenation and ventilation for an unresponsive, breathless near-drowning victim?
- [ ] Attempt to drain water from the breathing passages by performing the Heimlich maneuver
- [ ] Begin chest compressions
- [ ] Provide cervical spine stabilization because a diving accident may have occurred
- [ ] Open the airway and begin rescue breathing as soon as possible, even in the water
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>Option 4, beginning rescue breathing as soon as possible, is the correct answer.

40. In initiating CPR, nurse Angel knows it is important to do chest compressions correctly. What is the correct way of performing chest compressions?
- [ ] Compress more than 120 per minute
- [ ] The rescuer’s arms should be parallel to the victim’s body
- [ ] Compress for 5 cycles at 30 compressions each cycle
- [ ] Depth of compressions should be 4 inches
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>Option 3 is an accurate guideline for HQCPR. Compressions should be from 100 to 120 compressions per minute. The rescuer's arms should be perpendicular to the victim's body, and compress to a depth of 2 inches in adults or a third of the anteroposterior diameter of a child's thorax.

>[!INFO] Situation

45. One of the patients diagnosed with COPD is having difficulty breathing. Which is the best position to achieve maximal lung expansion?
- [ ] High fowlers
- [ ] Semi fowlers
- [ ] Supine
- [ ] Orthopneic
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>The orthopneic position, also known as the tripod position, as its name suggests, is a position that improves breathing.

>[!INFO] Situation
