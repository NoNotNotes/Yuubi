>[!INFO] Situation
>Dorie, 4 days old, is admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for management of her congenital heart disease, acyanotic type, with signs of congestive heart failure.

In assessing Dorie, the nurse would expect to observe:
- [ ] Acrocyanosis
- [ ] An elevated hematocrit
- [ ] Absence of femoral pulses
- [ ] Dyspnea and brow sweats during feeding
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>Dyspnea upon exertion and brow sweats are expected. Acrocyanosis would not occur in an acyanotic-type congenital heard disease. An elevated hematocrit is normally found in cases of dehydration, and an absence of femoral pulse is normally found in cases of vascular disease.

Thorough evaluation of Dorie revealed a large patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). A correct understanding of PDA will make the nurse anticipate which of the following symptoms?
- [ ] Becoming cyanotic during feeding and exertion
- [ ] Often assuming a squatting position
- [ ] Being acyanotic but having difficulty breathing after physical activity
- [ ] Having breathing difficulty and becoming cyanotic with slight activity
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>Option 3 is the correct answer. A patent ductus arteriosus is not a cyanotic congenital heart disease. Squatting after exertion is a sign indicative of the Tetralogy of Fallot.

Which of the following signs is the hallmark of a patent ductus arteriosus in newborn assessment?
- [ ] Machinery-like murmurs
- [ ] Dyspnea that is relieved by crying
- [ ] Acrocyanosis that is relieved by crying
- [ ] Circumoral cyanosis after feeding
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>Machinery-like murmurs are found in newborns with PDA.

When developing a plan of care for Dorie, who has congestive heart failure, pediatric doses of furosemide (Lasix) is given. The nurse should include in their plan frequent monitoring of which of the following?
- [ ] Weight increase
- [ ] Decrease in serum potassium
- [ ] Decrease in urine output
- [ ] Increase in respiratory rate
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>Furosemide, a loop diuretic, is a potassium-wasting diuretic. Monitor the child for serum potassium imbalances.

While on furosemide, which of the following nursing actions ensures the client's safety?
Measure body weight weekly
Document input and output strictly
Measure serum potassium for hyperkalemia
Assess the client for hypovolemia
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>I&O should be measured strictly. This also covers for the fourth option; assessing the client for hypovolemia, and as such is a better answer. Body weight measuring should be done daily. The serum potassium imbalance that occurs is hypokalemia, and not hyperkalemia.

>[!INFO] Situation
>Susie has cystic fibrosis, a multi-disorder of the exocrine gland characterized by thick pulmonary secretions. It is the most common cause of lung disease in children.

The physical assessment of Susie yielded signs and symptoms typical of cystic fibrosis. Which of the following is not a true sign of this disease?
- [ ] Undernutrition
- [ ] Decreased perspiration
- [ ] Clubbing of fingers
- [ ] Recurrent respiratory infection
>[!FAQ] Rationalization
>Perspiration is increased in children with cystic fibrosis. The remaining options of undernutrition, clubbing of fingers (from chronic hypoxia), and recurrent respiratory infection (secretions allow pathogens to grow) are all found in cystic fibrosis.

Susie, a school-aged child, also has asthma. Which of the following exercises is most appropriate?
- [ ] Running
- [ ] Basketball
- [ ] Swimming
- [ ] Baseball
>[!FAQ] Rationalization
>The most appropriate exercise is swimming, where the lungs may expand. Running, basketball, and baseball (which both include running) are too rigorous for Susie who has both cystic fibrosis and asthma.

A recommended treatment for cystic fibrosis to promote the clearing of thick secretions from the lower airway is:
- [ ] Postural drainage
- [ ] Narcotics
- [ ] Antitussives
- [ ] Antibiotics
>[!FAQ] Rationalization
>Only the first option addresses the secretions. Narcotics do not address the problem, antitussives further reduces the clearing of secretions. Antibiotics are not necessary.

Susie is order to continue taking Pancrelipase (Viokase). Which of the following verbalizations indicates a need for further teaching?
- [ ] "I should start avoiding fatty foods."
- [ ] "I should take the enzyme with or before meals."
- [ ] "Doubling the dose is okay if I eat jelly, fruit sherbets, and bread."
- [ ] "I should take it after the ordered antacid."
>[!FAQ] Rationalization
>Doses are never doubled. Pancrelipase is a pancreatic enzyme taken with other medications (proton pump inhibitor) to aid digestion for those with malabsorption syndromes related to the pancreas.
>- Fatty foods should be avoided.
>- As it aids with digestion, it is taken with or before meals.

When doing discharge teaching, the nurse instructs Susie who is taking Theophylline (Theodur) that she should avoid drinking which of these beverages?
- [ ] Tea and coffee
- [ ] Orange and grape juice
- [ ] Milk and milk shakes
- [ ] Cranberry juice
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>Theophylline is a bronchodilator used for the treatment of COPD and asthma. Caffeine should be avoided as these may result in tachycardia.

>[!INFO] Situation
>4-year-old David is admitted because of severe skin bruising and frequent, easy nose bleeding episodes. David is diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL).

Which of the following would be the priority nursing diagnosis for a preschool child with ALL?
- [ ] Risk for injury related to thrombocytopenia
- [ ] Oral mucous membranes, altered related to chemotherapy
- [ ] Interrupted family processes related to a life-threatening illness of a family member
- [ ] Fatigue related to the disease process
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>The priority nursing diagnosis is for the risk of injury related to thrombocytopenia. Chemotherapy was not mentioned as an on-going treatment in the statement. Family processes and fatigue are secondary when compared to injury.
>Test-taking strategy: utilize Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory to determine that risk of injury (physiological) takes precedence over fatigue and family.

The mother of a child with leukemia asks the nurse why sores developed in the mouth of her child. What is the most appropriate response of the nurse?
- [ ] "There is no need to worry; all kids receiving chemotherapy tend to have them."
- [ ] "Mouth sores result because the cells in the mouth are sensitive to chemotherapy."
- [ ] "The child's oral hygiene needs to be improved."
- [ ] "He is allergic to the drug. I will notify the doctor and ask for an alternative drug."
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>Option 2 is appropriate. Option 1 dismisses concerns, and options 3 and 4 are incorrect.

As part of a chemotherapy protocol, an adolescent is to receive cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan). To prevent the side effects of Cytoxan, she should be instructed to:
- [ ] Drink at least 2,500 mL of fluids each day
- [ ] Restrict iron in her diet
- [ ] Test her urine for acetone and glucose
- [ ] Brush her hair several times a day
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>The complication of the use of cyclophosphamide is hemorrhagic cystitis. Among the oncologic population, cyclophosphamide is the most common cause of hemorrhagic cystitis. The accumulation of the metabolites (acrolein) of the drug is what causes damage to the lining of the bladder. Adequate hydration is usually sufficient to prevent cystitis.

While on chemotherapy, David also takes ordered allopurinol (Zyloprim). The nurse should recognize that the purpose of Zyloprim for the child with ALL is to:
- [ ] Stimulate the kidneys to release erythropoietin, which stimulates erythrocyte production.
- [ ] Inhibit uric acid production.
- [ ] Promote the deposition of calcium in the long bones.
- [ ] Interfere with the production of leukemic cells.
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>Cancer medicines may elevate excess uric acid levels. For this, Allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, is given to inhibit uric acid production.

The nurse would prepare the parents of the child with suspected leukemia for which of the following tests that would confirm this diagnosis?
- [ ] Lumbar puncture
- [ ] Bone marrow aspiration
- [ ] Complete blood count
- [ ] Blood culture
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>Leukemia, a blood cancer that often begins in the bone marrow, can be confirmed with a bone marrow aspiration. Complete blood counts reflect the outcome of leukemia, but it is not a confirmatory test. Blood cultures and a lumbar puncture are unnecessary.

>[!INFO] Situation
>Liza, a neurologic nurse, is assigned in a special pediatric unit attending to varied neurologic disorders. Upon returning to the cubicle, a nurse that watches patients in the unit gather around Luis, a 5-year-old child with recurrent seizures (epilepsy), on the floor having an episode.

The best immediate response of the nurse would be to:
- [ ] Hold the child's arms down
- [ ] Cradle the child's head in her lap
- [ ] Move the child back to his bed
- [ ] Place something in the child's mouth
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>Cradling the child's head in her lap is the best answer; it provides safety for the patient.
>- A patient with epilepsy should not be restrained.
>- Moving the child back to bed is not an immediate response.
>- Placing objects in the child's mouth may only pose further risk.

The following statements concerning Epilepsy are true, with the exception:
- [ ] The causes of most cases of epilepsy remain unknown.
- [ ] There is still a stigma connected with the term epilepsy.
- [ ] The nursing diagnosis high-risk for injury is the priority in care of children with epilepsy.
- [ ] All cases of epilepsy can be controlled through medication.
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>Only option 4 is incorrect. Not all cases of epilepsy can be controlled through medication.

4-year-old Kathy is admitted for management of a brain tumor. While assessing Kathy, the nurse understands that the most important prognostic indicator for a child with neurologic impairment is which of the following?
- [ ] Level of consciousness
- [ ] Superficial reflexes
- [ ] Pupil reactivity
- [ ] Vital signs
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>Level of consciousness is the most important indicator of prognosis.

Kathy has signs of increased intracranial pressure for which an osmotic diuretic is ordered. The nurse prepares to administer which of these drugs?
- [ ] Furosemide (Lasix)
- [ ] Chlorothiazide (Duril)
- [ ] Mannitol
- [ ] Spironolactone (Aldactone)
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic. This type of diuretic manages intracranial pressure because they help reduce the fluid volume in the brain by using osmotic pressure to "pull" water out of the brain tissue and into the blood stream. It is also used for cases of cerebral edema.

For a client on diuretic therapy, which of the following is the most important primary assessment?
- [ ] Serum potassium, q4°
- [ ] Intake and output, q1°
- [ ] Weight, q3d
- [ ] CVP, q1°
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>Intake and output is the priority for a client on diuresis.
>- Serum potassium is checked every 8 hours.
>- Weight is measured daily.

>[!INFO] Situation
>Traction utilizes a pulling force to maintain a proper alignment of the bone so that healing can occur. A child with congenital hip dislocation is on Bryant's traction management.

The proper positioning for a child who is in Bryant's traction is:
- [ ] Both hips and knees maintained at 90-degree flexion angle, with the back flat on the bed.
- [ ] Both hips flexed at a 90-degree angle, with the knees extended and the buttock elevated off the bed.
- [ ] Affected hip maintained flexed and affected leg extended, with the buttock elevated off the bed.
- [ ] Both hips and legs extended, with the back flat on the bed.
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>Bryant's traction places both hips flexed at a 90° angle, with the knees extended. The buttocks are slightly elevated off of the bed. It is commonly used for DDH.

A child who sustained a closed fracture of the femur is admitted for treatment. When assessing for vascular injury, the nurse should be alert for signs of ischemia, which include:
- [ ] Increase in serum levels of creatinine, alkaline, phosphatase, and aspartate transaminase
- [ ] Bleeding, bruising, and hemorrhage
- [ ] Generalized swelling, pain, and decrease of or loss of function
- [ ] Pain, pallor, pulselessness, paresthesias, and paralysis
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>Option 4 is the same for signs of compartment syndrome, where neurovascular damage occurs. These findings indicate an emergency.

17-year-old Lorenzo sustained major injuries of the body, including a compound fracture of the shaft on the left femur in a motorcycle accident. Emergency treatment includes the application of a splint. How should the splint be applied?
- [ ] Apply it after aligning the involved limb
- [ ] Extend the splint from the fracture site downward
- [ ] Extend the splint from the fracture site upward
- [ ] Apply the split to the limb 
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>The limb should be left in the position it was found in, as moving it may cause further damage.

For care of children with compound fractures, which should be carried out initially by the nurse?
- [ ] Assess his respiratory status
- [ ] Cover the open wounds
- [ ] Prevent infections
- [ ] Clean the fracture site
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>Among the main complications of compound fractures is the risk for a pulmonary embolism as fat embolism syndrome. The remaining options are not as immediately urgent.

To achieve the desired outcome of functional healing of fractures, which nursing goal should receive the highest priority?
- [ ] Provide relief from pain
- [ ] Prevent infection with prophylactic antibiotics
- [ ] Provide optimum nutrition rich in protein, vitamin D, and calcium
- [ ] Maintain immobilization and alignment
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>Maintenance of functionality during healing of fractures involves proper immobilization and alignment. Nonunion, malunion, and delayed union are some consequences of improper immobilization and alignment, and all affect functioning.

A mother is watching her school-age child learn self-care techniques after being recently diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Which of the following is a correct statement?
- [ ] "Bandura's theory states children new behaviors best when imitating others."
- [ ] "Erikson's stages describes school-age children as learning by attaining goals."
- [ ] "Piaget believes that learning will take place more quickly when abstract thinking develops."
- [ ] "Freud's description of personality development affects learning ability."
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>Bandura's Theory of Imitation is most applicable to the child learning self-care techniques for their diagnosis.
>- School-age children are in their Industry vs. Inferiority stage.
>- School-age children are not yet fully capable of abstract thinking.
>- Freud's theories on personality development are not focused on learning ability.

During a developmental assessment, a parent complains that she has a "difficult" toddler. What advice would the nurse offer to the parent?
- [ ] "Toddlers are flexible. Accepting new rules will occur quickly."
- [ ] "Do not expect the child to adapt quickly to new situations."
- [ ] "Encourage associative play and this will get better."
- [ ] "Spanking your child will make the difficult behavior improve."
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>Option 2 is correct. The remaining options are false.

A mother who uses the time-out method of discipline for her 5-year-old child is asking the nurse what type of parenting this exemplifies. What is the response that would be most appropriate?
- [ ] Indifferent
- [ ] Authoritative
- [ ] Authoritarian
- [ ] Permissive
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>The exemplified parenting style is authoritative. Indifference leaves the child to their own devices; permissive *allows* the child to act out. Authoritarian approaches are similar to the time-out approach, but apply more severe or drastic approaches.

Which is the most important nursing intervention to facilitate communication with a hospitalized preschool-age child?
- [ ] Provide detailed explanations of procedures to the child.
- [ ] Encourage the child to engage in play with dolls, puppets, or safe medical equipment.
- [ ] Ask the child to write a story about the hospitalization.
- [ ] Keep visitors to a minimum.
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>Preschool-aged children may engage in play with dolls, puppets, or safe medical equipment.
>- Detailed explanations would not be appropriate for a preschool-age child.
>- Story-writing may not facilitate communication and may not be age-appropriate.
>- There is nothing indicating the need to minimize visitors. This may also be counterproductive.

A nurse is assessing a 2-year-old boy with the following vital signs: axillary temperature of 97.8°F, respiration rate of 28, and a blood pressure of 125/80.
- [ ] Reevaluate the child's temperature in 1 hour.
- [ ] Report the blood pressure to the physician.
- [ ] Assess for additional signs of respiratory distress in the child.
- [ ] Determine why the child has tachycardia.
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>Report to the physician about the child's elevated blood pressure.
>- The child's temperature and respiratory rate is within normal range.
>- Heart rate is not described in the findings.

Which statement indicates nutrition counseling has been effective for the mother of a 6-month-old infant?
- [ ] "I will start my infant on rice cereal since it is iron fortified and has little chance of causing allergy."
- [ ] "I will start my infant on egg whites since they are high in iron and protein and have little chance of causing allergy."
- [ ] "I will start feeding fruits and vegetables and progress to whole grain cereals as tolerated."
- [ ] "I know that I can start feeding my baby strained meats for the iron and protein and progress to more irritating fruits and vegetables."
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>Option 1 is correct. Cereal, vegetables, and fruits may be introduced to the infant at six months of age; iron-fortified foods are prioritized, as these nutrition is not found in breastmilk. Meat and table foods are introduced by 12 months of age.

Which observation during a healthcare visit alerts the nurse to the need for further developmental assessment in an infant?
- [ ] A four-month-old has just started to roll from front to back.
- [ ] A nine-month-old now stands while holding onto furniture.
- [ ] A nine-month-old is able to sit with support from pillows on each side.
- [ ] A 12-month-old says two words: "*dog*" and "*bottle*".
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>An eight-month-old child should be able to sit without support.

The nurse knows that teaching about car seat safety to the parents of a 4-year-old child has been effective when which statement is made?
- [ ] "Now that our child is 4 years old, weighs 40 pounds, and is 42 inches tall, we can move to a forward-facing booster seat."
- [ ] "Now that our child is 4 years old, she can sit in the regular car seat and use the seat belt and shoulder belt like adults."
- [ ] "Now that our child is 4 years old, she can sit in her booster seat in the front seat."
- [ ] "Our 4-year-old must stay in her forward-facing car seat until she is 6 years old."
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>The last option is correct*.

Which is the best advice the nurse can give to parents asking for help in handling their toddler's temper tantrums?
- [ ] "I think you should start using time-outs when he throws a temper tantrum."
- [ ] "Reward him for good behavior and the temper tantrums will decrease."
- [ ] "There is nothing to be done. They are a symptom of emotional instability."
- [ ] "Temper tantrums will increase in number through the preschool years."
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>Time-outs should be employed for temper tantrums in toddlers.
>- Option 2 provides false reassurance.
>- Option 3 is inaccurate and drastic.
>- Option 4 is inaccurate and does not address the issue.

The high school principal asks the school nurse to provide injury prevention information to the students. What does the nurse identify as priority for the majority of students?
- [ ] Driving and substance abuse
- [ ] CPR and emergency care
- [ ] Sports injuries
- [ ] Driving patterns
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>Driving and substance abuse is the best answer. CPR and emergency care is not relevant to the students. Sports injuries are common in school-aged children, not high schoolers. Driving patterns fall under option 1.
