# Module 1: Medication Administration
The administration of medication is a **dependent nursing action**. Doctor's orders are required for any medications given.
>[!IMPORTANT] Fundamental Rule: **never administer an unfamiliar medication**.

## Rights of Medication
The first six rights of medication listed are most important, but otherwise not in any particular order:
1. **Right Patient**: identify the patient with at least two identifiers. For this specific right, take into consideration that there are two categories of patients: conscious and unconscious.
	- **Conscious**: alert, coherent, and aware patients. For these clients, you may **ask the client to state their name**
	- **Unconscious**: comatose. For these clients, you may **check the ID bracelet/band/label**
2. **Right Drug**: there are four elements in checking the validity of the drug being given:
	- **Expiration**: check the date of expiration of the medication.
	- **Color**: changes in color can indicate errors or invalidity.
	- **Spelling**: in written prescriptions, the spelling of medication names should be double-checked. Some drugs can go as far as to differ by one syllable.
	- **Label**: checked thrice; once when receiving the order, second when opening or dispensing, and third when administering the medication.
3. **Right Dose**: **double-checking** is always imperative for giving drugs. No excess or deficit against the prescribed amount should be administered. This is done especially for (a) **multiple drugs**, (b) **sudden changes of orders**, (c) **available stock dose does not match order**. The relevant formulae used for calculating the required dose includes:
	- **Pediatric Doses**:
		- **Clark's Rule**: Weight (pounds) / 150 \* Adult Dose
		- **Fried's Rule** (12 months and below): Age (months)/150 \* Adult Dose
		- **Young's Rule**: Age (years) / (Age (years) + 12) \* Adult Dose
	- **Adult Doses**: Dose / Stock \* Quantity
	- **IV Calculation**: Total Volume / Hrs. to Infuse * Drop Factor / 60 Minutes
4. **Right Frequency**: the usage of correct intervals between dosages. This is written on the order, with standardized abbreviations. Depending on the institution, the timings of non-specific frequencies can vary.

6. **Right Documentation**: correct recording of medications given immediately after administration. Requisite documentation characteristics include comprehensiveness, brevity, and legibility.
	- Done **after the procedure**
	- Free of **erasures**; use strike-through for errors and append initials and a signature.
	- Free of **superimposition**
	- No blank spaces
	- Utilizes universal abbreviation
7. **Right Client Education**
8. **Right Assessment**
9. **Right Evaluation**
10. **Right to Refuse**

>[!DRUG] Medication Order (MO) vs. Telephone Order (TO).
>A **medication order** contains the name of the patient, the name of the drug, its dose, frequency, and route; the first five rights listed, along with the signature of the prescribing physician. All elements must be present for the validity of a prescription.
>
>A **telephone order** can provide the statement of the previously stated elements, except for the presence of a **signature**.
>- However, the prescribing physician should **countersign the order** based on institutional policies, within 24 hours, or by the next shift.
>- It may also be accepted for **emergency cases**.
>- Additionally, a **registered nurse** must be present to serve as a witness and for verification of the drug. Any unclear info provided should be inquired upon, such as the spelling of an uncommon drug.


## Parenteral Administration
Syringe-based administration. An invasive procedure that can be classified as ID, SC, IM, or IV. Because of its nature, it is considered as the most dangerous and the fastest method of administration. Apply **universal precautions**.
>[!ERROR] Universal Precaution
>1. **Handwashing**. Standard duration is 20 seconds, but cleaning of contaminated skin must be at least 60 seconds with increased friction. Handrubs are also now accepted, as long as the solution used is 70% or greater.
>2. **Never recap needles after use**. They are disposed of immediately, or at least should be recapped with the fishing technique.
>3. **Dispose sharps in a sharps container**.

| --------- | ----------- | ------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Length    | 3/8 - 5/8   | 5/8 - 1/2    | 1 1/2                            |
| Gauge     | 26 - 27     | 25 - 26      | Child: 24 - 25<br>Adult: 23 - 24 |

Administration through parenteral means, given its potential risks, should following these principles:
1. **ID**: **Bevel Up**. The bevel of the needle should be facing up, away from the skin. This facilitates the formation of a **wheal** or **bleb**. **No red ink** when marking the site. No massaging.
4. **SC**: **Rotate the site of injection**. This is to prevent lipodystrophy or lipoatrophy. This is the breakdown of subcutaneous fat from repeated administration. The interval between site is at least four weeks.
5. **IM**: **Aspirate** to check if a blood vessel has been punctured, before releasing the medication.
