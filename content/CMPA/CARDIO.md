# Inflammatory Diseases
## Pericarditis
**Inflammation of the pericardium**, the thin outer covering of the heart. It is associated with malignant neoplasms, idiopathic causes, infective organisms, as a post-MI syndrome (Dressler's Syndrome), post-pericardiotomy syndrome, systemic connective tissue disease, and chronic renal failure (due to metabolites), chest trauma
>[!INFO] Acute and Chronic Pericarditis
>- **Short-course Pericarditis**: <6 months.
>- **Chronic Constrictive Pericarditis** leads to thickening of the pericardium by fibrous tissue formation, which leads to rigidity and subsequently inadequate ventricular filling, which results in heart failure.
- **Clinical Manifestations**:
	1. **Pain** radiating to the neck, shoulder and back aggravated by inspiration, coughing and swallowing, and is worst when supine (inversely, relieved by sitting up or leaning forward)
	2. **Pericardial Friction Rub**: a scratchy, high-pitched sound produced by the visceral and parietal pericardium rubbing together.
	3. **Signs of RSHF** when pericardial rigidity develops.
	4. **Thickening of the Pericardium** as revealed by CXR or ECHO.
	5. **Increased WBC** count
	6. **Atrial Fibrillation** is also common
2. **Intervention**
	- **NSAID**s (inhibition of prostaglandin, which causes pain) for pain management
	- **Corticosteroids** if caused by an autoimmune disease.
	- **Antibiotics** if caused by m.o.
	- **Pericardial Drainage** (Pericardiocentesis, Pericardiostomy), the removed fluid may also be used for cultures and other studies.
	- **Radiation** or **Chemotherapy** if caused by malignancy.
	- **Hemodialysis** if caused by uremic pericarditis secondary to renal failure.
	- Positioning for comfort.
	- **Pericardiectomy** for those with chronic constrictive pericarditis.
	- Monitor for **Pericardial Effusion** (>50mL)
## Pericardial Effusion
The accumulation of fluid in the pericardial cavity, which may eventually result in **cardiac tamponade**.
1. **Clinical Manifestations**:
	- **Jugular Distention**: increased CVP
	- **Pulsus Paradoxus**: hypotension with a further decrease of BP during inspiration.
	- **Distant/Muffled Heart Sounds**
	- **Circulatory Collapse** as a result of decreased cardiac output.
	- **Altered Perfusion** (brain: lethargy, stuporous; systematic: cool, clammy skin; kidneys: oliguria)
2. **Intervention**
3. **Emergency Care**: **Pericardiocentesis**
4. **Nursing Responsibilities**:
	- Preparation of items such as PPE, skin prep., sterile field, etc.
	- The patient is positioned in a semi/high-fowlers to allow gravity to help drain pericardial effusion.
## Myocarditis
**Inflammation of the muscular layer of the heart**. Abnormal function resulting from inflammation reduces CO and predisposes the client to CHF. Ischemia of the myocardium results in tachycardia and dysrhythmias. Its complication is **cardiomyopathy**, where myocardial dilation and hypertrophy occurs, which ends up in decompensation.
1. **Causes**:
	- Viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic **infection**.
	- **Chronic alcohol and cocaine abuse**
	- Secondary to **Radiation Therapy**
	- **Autoimmune Disorders**
	- Bulimic patients **abusing Ipecac Syrup** to induce vomiting, causing myocardial damage.
	- May be idiopathic.
2. **Clinical Manifestations**:
	- Pain, Fever, Tachycardia, Dysrhythmias, Dyspnea, Malaise, Fatigue, Anorexia, Pallor/Cyanosis, Symptoms of Right-Sided Heart Failure
	- Increased WBC, Elevated CRP, Elevated Cardiac Enzymes, Abnormal ECG
	- **CXR** and **ECHO** reveals cardiomegaly
	- Most definitive: **endomyocardial biopsy** for testing
3. **Interventions**:
	- Treatment of underlying cause (**antibiotics** if m.o.)
	- **Bed rest**, **Na<sup>+</sup> restriction**, **Cardiotonic Drugs** (Digitalis)
	- **Monitor**:
		- Cardiopulmonary status and complications (CHF, Dysrhythmias)
		- Vital Signs, Daily Weight, I&O
		- Heart and Lung Sounds
		- Pulse Oximetry
		- Cardiac Monitoring
		- **Dependent Edema**
## Rheumatic Fever
Inflammation that follows an **URTI** (tonsillitis, pharyngitis, laryngitis) caused by **GABHS**. When the heart becomes affected, it becomes known as *Rheumatic Carditis* or *Endocarditis*.
1. **Pathophysiology**:
	- Antibodies are formed to destroy GABHS, which cross-react to proteins found in the connective tissues of the heart, joints, skin, and nervous system.
	- This may result in **Pancarditis**, inflammation of all layers of the heart including valvulitis.
	- WBCs migrate to the endocardium where the inflammation is, which end up accumulating inflammatory debris (dead cells from phagocytosis) called "*vegetations*" around the valve leaflets, which can cause obstruction in blood flow (circulatory stasis).
	- The **vegetations or thrombi formed from obstruction may embolize** and settle in any part of the body.
	- **Atrial fibrillation** may result from the vegetations.
2. **Clinical Findings**:
	1. **Major/Classic Symptoms** include manifestations of the autoimmune reaction towards the heart, joints, nervous system, and skin.
		- **Carditis**: characterized by the formation of **Aschoff's Bodies**, **Murmurs**, and a **Pericardial Friction Rub**, which may result in **CHF**.
		- **Polyarthritis**: swelling of multiple joints that is warm, red, and painful.
		- **Chorea** (*Sydenham's Chorea*, *St. Vitu's Dance*): involuntary grimacing and inability to use skeletal muscles in a coordinated manner (involvement of the CNS)
		- **Subcutaneous Nodules**: marble-sized nodules around the joints.
		- **Erythema Marginatum**: quickly-disappearing red spotty rashes that leave irregular circles on the skin.
	2. **Minor Symptoms**:
		- Reliable **history** of RF or evidence of pre-existing RHF.
		- **Arthralgia** without inflammation, pain, or limited movement
		- **Fever**: 38.9째C - 40.0째C
		- Increased **ESR**, **ASO Filter** and **CRP**
		- **ECG**: Prolonged PR Interval
3. **Diagnostic Evaluation**: a clinical diagnosis of Rheumatic Carditis is done with the **Jones Criteria**. It requires positive findings of **two major symptoms**, or **a major symptom accompanied by two minor symptoms, as well as supporting evidence of a recent streptococcal infection**.
4. **Interventions**: **the best intervention is prevention**. Use **early identification** of streptococcal infection and apply prophylaxis with proper antibiotics.
>[!TIP]- Signs and Symptoms of Streptococcal Pharyngitis
>- Fever (38.9째C - 40째C)
>- Chills
>- Sore Throat
>- Diffuse redness of throat with exudates on the oropharynx.
>- Enlarged/tender lymph nodes (Cervical Lymphadenopathy)
>- Abdominal Pain
>- Acute Sinusitis and Acute Otitis Media
5. **Management**:
	- **Antibiotics**, the drug of choice of which is penicillin.
	- **Aspirin** as an anticoagulant
	- **Steroids** as an antiinflammatory
	- **Antipyretics** and **Hydration** for fevers
	- **Antibiotic Prophylaxis** with a monthly injection of penicillin
	- **Bed Rest** with diversionary low-effort activities
	- **Assess** for progression or improvement of **heart involvement**
## Heart Failure
Heart failure is the **loss of pumping ability of the heart**. It may be categorized as Left-Sided or Right-Sided Heart Failure (LSHF, RSHF).
1. **Causes**: there are many causes, but in terms of physiological changes, the following are found in heart failure:
	- Preload is greatly reduced (e.g. hypovolemia)
	- Preload is greatly increased (e.g. hypervolemia, pancytopenia)
	- Afterload is obstructed or difficult (e.g. valvular stenosis/regurgitation, hypertension)
	- Damage to the heart muscle (e.g. cardiomyopathy, M.I.)
	- Increased metabolic states (e.g. Hyperthyroidism, Graves Disease, Pheochromocytoma)
2. **Compensatory Mechanisms of the Heart**: **Ventricular Dilatation**, **Ventricular Hypertrophy**, and **Sympathetic Nervous System Stimulation** (Tachycardia) all occur. However, once the heart reaches its physical limit, cardiac decompensation occurs.
3. **Clinical Manifestations**:
	1. **Left-Sided Heart Failure**: LSHF will always be followed by RSHF if left untreated.
		- Forward Effect: Decreased Systemic Perfusion (Cerebral, Renal, Body Cells)
		- Backward Effect: **Pulmonary Congestion** and Edema
	2. **Right-Sided Heart Failure**
		- Backward Effect: **Systemic Congestion**; **distended jugular veins**, increased CVP, hepatosplenomegaly (Increased SGPT & SGOT), **edema** (dependent, ascites, generalized), G.I. Distress (and anorexia)
	- **Heart/Lung Sounds**: "**galloping horse**", crackles/rales (blowing into a can of soda with a straw).
	- The patient feels like they are drowning.
4. **Diagnostic Evaluation**
	- **CXR**: **Cardiomegaly**
	- **Pleural Effusion**
	- **ECG**: ventricular hypertrophy, dysrhythmias
	- **ECHO**: reveals cardiac valvular changes, pericardial effusions, chamber enlargement, and ventricular hypertrophy.
5. **Medical Management**:
	- **Lifestyle changes**: **Low Na<sup>+</sup>** Diet and **Fluid Restrictions**
	- **Inotropic Agents**: Increased contractility, slows heart rate and conduction.
	- **Digoxin** (Lanoxin): the mainstay treatment for HF.
		- Also decreases sympathetic activity and increases parasympathetic activity.
		- Always check for digitalis toxicity (0.5 to 2 ng/mL), the main presenting symptom of which is bradycardia, along with anorexia, N&V, rapid, slow, irregular heart rate, and disturbance in color vision.
		- Antidote: **Digibind**
		- Do not administer if assessment is found to be <60 BPM and supplement potassium if patient is hypokalemic.
	- **Dopamine** (Intropin), **Dobutamine** (Dobutrex)
	- **Diuretics**: **Furosemide** (Lasix), **Chlorothiazide** (Diuril). Inhibition loss of sodium means potassium is exchanged and excreted in turn. A serum test is done prior to usage of **Furosemide**, and supplementation is ordered if hypokalemic. Hypokalemia also contributes to digitalis toxicity due to its direct effect on cardiac contraction.
	- **Vasodilators**: **Nitroglycerin**
	- **ACE Inhibitors**: "-*pril*s"
6. **Nursing Management**: most clients manage chronic heart failure at home.
	- Administer prescriptions and evaluate effect.
	- Promote **positive cardiac output**.
	- Monitor for excess fluid volume (**weight gain**) and electrolyte imbalances (especially of potassium, from the use of diuretics).
	- **Promote oxygenation** and **balance activity** according to tolerance.
## Pulmonary Edema
The accumulation of fluid in the lungs. This may be caused by LSHF, but may also be caused by non-cardiogenic conditions such as pulmonary embolisms, infection, and alteration of the pulmonary capillary membranes.
1. **Clinical Manifestations**:
	- Dyspnea, Orthopnea
	- Wheezing
	- Restlessness
	- **Productive cough with pink frothy sputum**
	- Cyanosis
	- Tachycardia
	- Apprehension
	- **ABG**: Metabolic and Respiratory Acidosis, Severe Hypoxemia (<50mmHg PaO2, >50mmHg PaCO2)
2. **Medical Management**:
	- **Drug Therapy**
		- **Inotropes**: Dopamine (Intropin), Dobutamine (Dobutrex), Amrinone (Inocor), Digitalis
		- **Diuretics**
		- **Vasodilators** e.g. nitrates, ACE Inhibitors, Ca++-channel blocker
		- **Morphine** for anxiety, apprehension
	- **Oxygen Therapy**
	- If ineffective, **invasive measures** are used.

# Coronary Artery Diseases
These are diseases that involve any of the coronary arteries (LADA, RDA, Circumflex Branch, etc.) that supply oxygen to the heart. These diseases can eventually result in myocardial ischemia, injury, and infarction.
>[!INFO] Atherosclerosis, Arteriosclerosis, and Arteriolosclerosis
>Arteriosclerosis is the **hardening** of the blood vessel due to any cause. If caused by plaque/fatty deposits, it becomes **atherosclerosis**.
>
>Arteriolosclerosis is the **thickening** of the blood vessel walls, implicitly causing hardening of the blood vessel walls (Arteriosclerosis).

## Angina Pectoris
Paroxysms of **pain** or a feeling of **pressure** in the anterior chest caused by insufficient coronary blood flow. It is usually a result of atherosclerosis. If unmanaged, it can progress to acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, heart failure, or cardiogenic shock
1. **Clinical Manifestations**: poorly localized **retrosternal pain**, apprehension, impending feeling of death, weakness/numbness of extremities, LOC changes, diaphoresis, pallor. An important characteristic is the relief of pain when the precipitating factor is removed or if nitroglycerin is used.
>[!INFO] Gerontologic Considerations
>Elderly persons with angina may not exhibit a typical pain profile due to diminished responses of neurotransmitters. Often, the presenting symptoms is **dyspnea**, and some cases may be entirely asymptomatic ("*Silent CAD*").
2. **Diagnostic  Evaluation**: ECG changes, Blood Tests (Cardiac Biomarkers), ECHO/Catheterization/Angiography
3. **Medical Management**: decrease oxygen demand and increase oxygen supply. **Percutaneous Coronary Intervention** (PCI) procedures (PTCA, Intracoronary Stents, Atherectomy) and pharmacologic therapy.
4. **Pharmacologic Management**: **nitroglycerin** (nitrates in general, the mainstay of treatment), **beta-blockers** (-olols; metoprolol, atenolol), **calcium channel blockers** (-dipines; amlodipine, diltiazem), **anticoagulants/thrombolytics** (aspirin, heparin), **oxygen**.
5. **Nursing Diagnoses**:
	- Ineffective cardiac tissue perfusion secondary to CAD as evidenced by chest pain or other prodromal symptoms.
	- Death anxiety
	- Deficient knowledge about underlying disease and methods for avoiding complications.
	- Noncompliance, ineffective management of therapeutic regimen to failure to accept necessary lifestyle changes.
6. **Nursing Management**:
	- **Treating Angina**: immediate bed rest in semi-fowler's position, administer sublingual nitroglycerin and evaluate effect, oxygen therapy, monitor for MI and complications (respiratory distress). If pain persists after intervention, assess for acute MI.
	- **Reducing Anxiety**: explore the implications of the diagnosis for the patient. Provide essential information and preventive interventions.
	- **Preventing Pain**: identify the level of tolerable activity, and plan activities accordingly. Rest periods should be used as necessary. Precipitating factors include exertion, cold exposure, tobacco use (causes vasoconstriction), heavy meals, obesity, and some drugs.
## Myocardial Infarction
Myocardial tissue death resulting from an **imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand**. This may be a development of angina. Its pathophysiology involves the ruptures of atherosclerotic plaques, coronary artery occlusion, and vasospasm. If management is not adequate, it may produce acute pulmonary edema, heart failure, cardiogenic shock, dysrhythmias and cardiac arrest, pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade.
1. **Clinical Manifestations**: chest pain similar to unstable AP, but one that **does not cease when rest and medication are implemented**. Decreased perfusion of the skin results in cool skin and pallor. Sympathetic nervous system stimulation from heart failure results in tachycardia and tachypnea. Impaired cardiac output also produces indigestion, nausea, and anxiety.
2. **Diagnostic  Evaluation**: ECG within 10 minutes of pain onset (Inverted T, **Elevated ST**, then Abnormal Q) and ECHO for assessment of ventricular function; Cardiac biomarkers (CK-MB, Myoglobin, Troponin) are assessed.
3. **Medical Management**: **thrombolytics** (TPA, Streptokinase), **PCIs** (PTCA, CABG, MIDCAB), **bed rest**, **oxygenation**
4. **Pharmacologic Management**: **nitrates**, **anticoagulants/thrombolytics** (aspirin, heparin), analgesics (morphine sulfate), ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers. (*mn. MONA for Morphine, Oxygenation, Nitroglycerin, Aspirin*)
5. **Nursing Assessment**: **baseline data**, LOC, chest pain, heart rate and rhythm, organ function, blood pressure, skin color and temperature.
6. **Nursing Diagnoses**:
	- Ineffective cardiac tissue perfusion related to reduced coronary blood flow
	- Risk for imbalanced fluid volume
	- Risk for ineffective peripheral tissue perfusion related to decreased cardiac output from left ventricular dysfunction
	- Death anxiety
	- Deficient knowledge about post-ACS self-care
7. **Nursing Management**:
	- **Relieve pain** via MONA. Assess vital signs frequently while pain persists. A cardiac chair or a back-elevated position decreases chest discomfort and dyspnea.
	- **Improve respiratory function** to increase oxygenation. Assessment is also helpful in detecting early signs of complications. Deep breathing and positioning helps in preventing the pooling of fluid in lung bases.
	- **Promoting adequate tissue perfusion**: bed or chair rest reduces myocardial oxygen consumption. Signs of failing tissue perfusion (skin temperature, peripheral pulses) are assessed frequently.
	- **Reducing anxiety**: develop a trusting and caring nurse-patient relationship. Provide information. Ensure a quiet, non-interruptive environment. Concerns and fears are discussed with the patient.
	- **Monitoring Complications**: monitor cardinal signs and symptoms of the onset of complications.
