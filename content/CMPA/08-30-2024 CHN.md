# Demography
The study of the population, entailing not only the size, but the composition and distribution as well. Some sources of demographic data include:
1. **Census**: either **de jure** (actual residence), or **de facto** (based on where the individual is currently situated) performed by the National Government. It is the most expensive form of data collection in terms of both money and time (done every 10 years).
2. **Registration System**: records of vital events e.g. birth certificate, death certificate
	- Births should be reported within 30 days by the birth attendant or who birthed the child to the local civil registry.
	- Deaths%%incomplete%%. In terms of location to register, this should be done where the death had occurred. The certificate should be signed by the municipal health officer.
3. **Sample Survey**: selecting a small subset of the community in order to represent the entire community.
## Population Size
In the Philippines, the global population is increasing by 1.6% (2020). In general, this change is based on **absolute increase**; calculated by deducting deaths from births. The same represented in percentage is called the **relative increase**.
- The age group with the most births is the 25 to 29 year old bracket of women.
- The total fertility rate includes all women from 15 to 49 years old who are still within the reproductive age. As of 2022, the amount of children per woman is 1.9.
- **Crude Birth Rate** (CBR) is the rate of births. The inversion is **Crude Death Rate** (CDR), the rate of death. The *rate of natural increase* is $\text{CBR}-\text{CDR}$.
- The most common cause of mortality is **lifestyle**; the most common cause of morbidity is **infection**.

The population may also be denoted based on its composition, a primary example being of its *gender*. This is calculated with the **sex ratio**:
$$\text{Sex Ratio}=\frac{\text{Males}}{\text{Females}\times100}$$

Composition may also be represented by age. The **median age** denotes the middle point of age in the population. Others include:
- The **Dependency Ratio**: the number of people who are *economically dependent* (unemployed, not employable; 0 to 14 years old, 65 years old and above) or *economically independent* (able to work; 15 to 64 years old).
$$\text{Dependency Ratio}=\frac{\text{Dependent}}{\text{Independent}}\times100$$

The representation of both **age** and **sex** with one graph utilizes the **population pyramid graph**.
%%Image of population pyramid%%

The **geographical and housing distribution** of the population can be quantified through the following:
1. **Urban-Rural Distribution**: the distribution of the population between urban and rural areas.
2. **Crowding Index**: number of individuals per room in a household. Exceeding two indicates increased risk, especially for communicable diseases.
3. **Population Density**: number of individuals within a given area (per kmÂ²).

# Field Health Services and Information System (FHSIS)
1. **Individual Treatment Record** (ITR): the foundation or primary building block of FHSIS. It is a basic patient consultation record or a bond paper which bears the date, name, address, height, weight, chief complaint, and presenting signs and symptoms, the diagnosis (if available), treatment, and date of treatment of each family member who consulted in the health center.
2. **Target Client List** (TCL): the secondary building block of FHSIS. It reflects the list of "target" or eligible clients or individuals for a particular health program. It facilitates the monitoring and supervision of service delivery activities and determines the patient's compliance to a particular program.
3. **Summary Table**: a 12-month table filled on a monthly basis to tally the number of clients in the barangay health facility in terms of **health program accomplishments** and **morbidity diseases**.
4. **Monthly Consolidation Table**: a form filled up by the PHN to put together the data reported by all midwives of the city or municipality. It is an essential form and serves as an output table of the RHU because it consists of the reported data per indicator by each Barangay Health Station or public health midwife.
## Reporting Forms
There are monthly reports:
1. **Program Report** (M1)
2. **Morbidity Report** (M2)

Quarterly reports:
1. **Program Report** (Q1)
2. **Morbidity Report** (Q2)

and Annual reports:
The Annual Form 1 (A1) consists of data and indicators needed only on a yearly basis on demographic, environmental, natality, and mortality. Annual Form 2 (A2) is the report enlisting all the diseases which have occurred in a city or municipality over the year according to age and sex. Lastly, Annual Form 3 (A3) reports all mortality cases or deaths in a municipality over the year according to to age and sex.
