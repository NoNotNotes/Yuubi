title: 10-21-2024 Labor and Delivery
date: 2024-10-21
---
**Labor and Delivery** is the expulsion of all the products of conception. Any parts retained will result in uterine atony, which enhances bleeding. The length of gestation is 9 months or 37 to 42 weeks.
- Contraction is prevented by **progesterone** which acts against **estrogen**, **oxytocin** (main hormone of contraction), **fetal cortisol**, and **prostaglandin**. Once progesterone fails to hold back the contractile stimulation, labor begins.
- Progesterone decreases on the ninth month because of the **placental degradation** after it reaches its lifespan limit. This starts contractions, and the mother enters labor and delivery.

More **theories of labor** include:
1. **Oxytocin Theory**: the pressure of the fetal head on the cervix in late pregnancy stimulates the posterior pituitary gland to secrete oxytocin, which cases uterine contractions.
2. **Uterine Stretch Theory**: the stretching of the uterus to an adequate size results in increased production of prostaglandin and oxytocin.
3. **Aging Placenta Theory**: after maturation, more pressure is exerted on the fundal portion, the usual placental site, and the most contractile portion of the uterus. It is believed that the resultant diminished blood supply to the area causes contraction.


Labor begins with the premonitory signs of labor:
1. **Lightening**: the entrance of the presenting part into the pelvic inlet, which relieves dyspnea and enhances urinary frequency. This occurs one to two weeks prior to delivery in primigravida, and one to two days prior to delivery in labor.
2. **Weight Loss**: secondary to nesting behavior of around 2 to 3 pounds prior to labor and delivery
3. **Increased Tension and Fatigue**: tension from beginning contractions (Braxton Hicks) and fatigue from nesting behavior.
4. **Cervical Changes**: effacement (thinning of the internal os;  to 100%) and dilatation (widening of the diameter of the external os; 0 to 10 cm)
5. **"Nesting Behavior"**: last minute preparation for delivery; purchasing maternal and child goods
6. **Rupture of the Bag of Water**
7. **Braxton Hicks**: painless, irregular contractions that are signs of false labor.

>[!TIP] Bag of Water
>The infant must be delivered within **four hours** of rupture as this permits the occurrence of ascending infection. Once likely, the mother's temperature is checked to detect the onset of **fever**.
>
>The **color** of the water is normally clear. If stained (green or yellow) with meconium, the fetus may be in **distress**. Check for the fetus' heart rate (normally 120 to 160). In early distress, the finding is **tachycardia**, which progresses to **bradycardia**.

# Stages of Labor (DEPR)
1. **Dilatation** (from the onset of true labor to full dilatation)
	- Nursing Responsibility: **monitor the progress of labor**, determining the progression of labor through the three phases of this stage

| Parameter            | Latent              | Active                          | Transitional           |     |
| -------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------- | --- |
| Dilatation           | 0 – 3 cm            | **4 – 7 cm**                    | 8 – 10 cm              |     |
| Duration             | <40s                | **40 – 60s**                    | 60 – 90s               |     |
| Frequency            | q5min               | **q3 – 5min**                   | q1 ½ – 2min            |     |
| Intensity            | Mild%% – Moderate%% | **Moderate%% – Strong%%**       | Strong (but not tonic) |     |
| Maternal<br>Behavior | Cooperative         | **Ambivalent/Less Cooperative** | Uncooperative          |     |
2. **Expulsion** (from full dilatation to the delivery of the baby)
	- Nursing Responsibility: **delivery the baby safely**
3. **Placenta** (from the delivery of the baby to the delivery of the placenta)
4. **Recovery** (two hours after placental expulsion)
## Five Ps of Labor and Delivery
The five Ps of labor are all necessary in order to undergo a normal pregnancy. With problems in any of the five Ps will result in difficult labor and delivery: **dystocia**.
1. **Power**: the forces that will push the baby out. The primary source of power is **contraction** that originates from the myometrium of the fundus in the upper uterus. The secondary source of power is the ability of the mother to **bear down** or push.
	- **Maternal pushing** is **not done without full effacement and dilatation**, as this may result in laceration of the cervical canal. An uncontrollable urge to push is felt during the **transitional phase** of labor, but should be held back through **panting** ("blowing candle" technique, alleviates urges; relaxes the abdomen).

>[!INFO] Parameters of Uterine Contractions
>1. **Frequency**: the time from the onset of one contraction to the onset of the next contraction ("*Increment to increment*")
>2. **Duration**: the length of one contraction ("*Increment to decrement"*)
>3. **Interval**: the time from the end of one contraction to the start of the next contraction ("*Decrement to Increment*")
>
>![[contraction_waveform.png]]

2. **Passageway**: the birth canal and its structures (pelvis, cervical canal, vaginal canal). The cervical canal is tasked with effacement and dilatation, while the vaginal canal requires adequate distensibility.
	- **Type of the Pelvis**: gynecoid and anthropoid are those fitted to pregnancy

| Cavity | AP  | Transverse | Oblique |
| ------ | --- | ---------- | ------- |
| Inlet  | 11  | 13         | 12      |
| Cavity | 12  | 12         | 12      |
| Outlet | 13  | 11         | 12      |
3. **Passenger**: (see prev. discussion on this):
	- The size of the baby affects the ease or difficulty of delivery, especially with **cephalopelvic disproportion** when the fetus is too large to pass through the pelvis. The normal birth weight of a neonate is 2,500 to 3,400 (maximum of 4,000) grams.
	- Number of children: normally one; if more, then the issue of positioning becomes a problem, especially if one baby is transverse while the other baby is longitudinal.
	- The positioning of the passenger affects the ease of delivery.
		- **Fetal Presentation**: cephalic, breech, transverse
		- **Attitudes**: flexion (normal) or extension of the head
		- **Lie**: longitudinal (cephalic, breech), transverse, oblique
		- **Position**: most commonly LOA, landmarks: occiput, mentum, sacrum
>[!INFO] Auscultation of Fetal Heart Tone
>The fetal heart tone is **best heard along the back**; for cephalic babies (occiput, mentum), the lower quadrant is used, while the upper quadrant is used for breech babies (sacrum). The same side of the abdomen is used for the occiput and sacrum, while the opposite side of the abdomen is used for the sacrum.

4. **Psyche**: the maternal state of mind and psychological safety. This may be supported physically, emotionally, and psychologically through **prenatal checkups**, **companion of choice**, or through the **nurse** (therapeutic touch, updating the mother on the progress of labor)
5. **Placental Factors**: dysfunctions of the placement or detachment of the placenta, among other abnormalities:
	- **Placenta Previa**: the placement of the placenta in the lower uterus, ranging being lateral to the passageway or completely obstructing the passageway.
	- **Abruptio Placenta**: the early detachment of the placenta from the uterus.

>[!EXAMPLE] Exercise (hidden)
%%>Mrs. Troy is at term and undergoing labor. She started to feel contractions at 9:55 AM that ended at 9:56:10 AM. This was followed by another contraction at 9:57:40 AM that ended at 9:58:55 AM. Her cervix is 8 cm dilated with a ruptured bag of water. The baby is at +2 station. Examination reveals a vertex presentation with the back at the right side of her abdomen. She had 1 abortion and a stillbirth at 35 weeks. She left home her twin sons born at 40 weeks. Determine her GPTPALM, stage, phase, presentation, attitude, lie, position, and FHR auscultation site. Calculate the duration, frequency, and interval of the (first) contraction.
>>[!TIP]- Answer (not posted, will post soon)
>>- **G4P2<sub>21121</sub>**: four pregnancies, two deliveries (twins, stillbirth), two term babies, one preterm baby, one abortion, two living children, and one multiple delivery.
>>- The pregnancy is in **Stage 1** (Dilatation), **Phase 3** (Transitional)
>>- The baby has a **cephalic** presentation with an attitude of **flexion**, lying **longitudinally**, positioned **ROA**, with the FHR auscultation site at the **right lower quadrant**.
>>- The first contraction lasted for 70 seconds. The interval to the next contract took 1 minute and 30 seconds. The frequency is 2 minutes and 40 seconds.%%

# Essential Intrapartal and Newborn Care (EINC)
A mandated series of steps in the care of the newborn during and immediately after delivery. The ENC (December 2009) attempted to answer the Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5 (Maternal and Child Mortality, respectively). The goal is to decrease mortality rates by 40%. This was achieved for mothers, but only 20% for neonates. To push neonatal health further, the previously established ENC was updated to the EINC (May 2012) to further improve outcomes of pregnancy.

## In Pre-Pregnant and Childbearing-Age Women
1. **Healthy Lifestyle**: exercise and the **avoidance of alcohol** (Low IQ; cognitive impairment) and **smoking** (Vasoconstriction; SGA, IUGR). Even residues of these can affect a pregnancy even after cessation.
2. **Health Teachings**:
	- Prevention of **venereal diseases** (STDs), **family planning**, and **conception**.
	- **Nutritional requirements**: (inc.)

| Component | Amount                 |
| --------- | ---------------------- |
| Calories  | 2,000/day              |
| Iron      | 30 mg/day              |
| Salt      | Iodized, not Rock Salt |
## In Pregnant Women
Exercises and avoidance of smoking and alcohol are still practiced during pregnancy.
1. **Prenatal checkups** are utilized to track the progress of gestation. The minimum recommended is four visits (DOH), at least once per trimester, and one at the final month of pregnancy.
2. **Dieting requirements**:

| Component                     | Amount                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Calories**                  | 2,300 to 2,500/day                                          |
| **Iron**                      | 60 mg/day                                                   |
| **Folic Acid**                | 400 mcg/day                                                 |
| **Calcium**                   | 1,200 mg/day                                                |
| **Protein**                   | 60 mg/day                                                   |
| **Vitamin A**                 | 10,000 IU 2nd Trimester                                     |
| **Elemental Iodine**          | 250 mg (1 cap)/pregnancy; can relieve need for iodized salt |
| **Increased fiber and fluid** | Prevent constipation                                        |
3. **Exercises**:
	- **Walking** (best)
	- **Pelvic Rocking**: the assumption of a squatting position, and rocking the pelvis forward and backwards. This relieves back pain.
	- **Tailor Sitting**: The assumption of indian seating on a non-slip mat, and stretching of the perineal tissues. This makes the perineum supple (elastic, stretchy) to prevent easy laceration.
	- **Squatting**: with support from a sturdy surface; this strengthens perineal muscles.
	- **Kegel's Exercise**: strengthens the perineal (pelvic floor) muscles.
4. **Antenatal Steroids**: the administration of steroids for pregnant women with (a) history of premature birth, (b) risk of preterm birth (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, anemia), (c) history of vaginal bleeding during pregnancy, and (d) actual **preterm labor**. These steroids are given from the 24th to 28th week to **promote surfactant production** (fetal lung maturity).
	- **Dexamethasone**: 6 mg IM every 12 hours for four doses.
	- **Betamethasone** (Celestone): 12 mg IM every 24 hours for two doses. In emergent cases, this is used because of its higher dosage.
>[!WARNING] For patients with history of premature labor, risk of premature labor, or history of bleeding, the patient can **complete the dosage**. Otherwise, in actual premature labor, **one dose is enough**.
## In the Labor Room
1. Admit the patient when they reach the **active phase** (4 cm dilatation or 2-3 contractions every 10 minutes), with her **companion of choice**.
2. **Positioning**: any upright position, whichever the patient deems more comfortable.
3. **End of NPO**: the woman can begin to eat.
4. **End of IV Infusion**, including oxytocin incorporation
5. **Perform IE** to monitor the progress of labor. This is done less than five times.
6. **Empty the bladder**
7. **No more shaving**
8. **No more enema**
## In the Delivery Room
1. **Prepare the milieu**: temperature (25°C to 28°C), without air drafts. The AC unit is closed **just before the baby is delivered** to avoid **hypothermia**.
>[!SUCCESS] Safe Delivery Techniques
>- Maintain the **semi-upright position**, with the COC present.
>- Perform **Ritgen's Maneuver** to support the perineal muscles during crowning, preventing lacerations.
>- **Check for cord coil** once the head and neck are exposed.
>- **Oxytocin IM** is given one minute after the baby is out (after initiation of early skin-to-skin contact).
>- **Perform the [[#Newborn Protocols (Principles of Unang Yakap)|four newborn protocols]]**

>[!FAIL] Procedures Not Routinely or Not Performed
>- **Amniotomies**: only performed when indicated
>- **Episiotomies**: only performed when indicated
>- **Coached pushing**: the mother bears down according to her urges
>- **Fundal pushing**: which can produce lacerations
>- **Brandt-Andrew's Maneuver**: not used; rather, **controlled cord traction with counter traction** is used to express the placenta.
>- **Cord Milking**, which may result in neonatal circulatory overload
>- **Methergine IM**

## Newborn Protocols (Principles of Unang Yakap)
1. **Immediate Drying** of the newborn within **30 seconds**. This prevents **hypothermia** with the poor thermoregulation of the baby.
2. **Skin-to-skin Contact** within the next 30 seconds (1 minute total) to promote bonding, **promote heat regulation**, and promote transfer of skin flora. This prevents **hypoglycemia** (from shivering) and **infection**.
3. **Properly Timed (Delayed) Cord Clamping and Cutting** within three minutes (until cord pulsations stop). This prevents **anemia** of the baby (allow more blood to enter fetal circulation before pulsations stop). **Do not milk the cord**, as this may result in circulatory overdose.
4. **Rooming-in and Early Initiation of Breastfeeding** (for the first 90 minutes): the mother and newborn is kept in the same room to promote the **initiation of breastfeeding** and bonding.
