# Expanded Program on Immunization
**Immunization** is an essential public health service and is commonly defined as the process of conferring artificial immunity to population groups. **Immunity** is described as resistance and protection from disease attributed to the presence of antibodies in the blood. The **National Immunization Program** (NIP) is committed to guaranteeing free immunization services and ensures that Filipinos, especially the poor, have access to routinely recommended vaccines. It further guarantees the immunization of **neonates**, **infants**, **children**, **adolescents**, **mothers**, and **elderly** populations as part of the comprehensive strategy for disease prevention and control following the life stage approach. Its goal is **to reduce morbidity and mortality** among infants and children caused by common childhood immunizable diseases. Specifically, the NIP has the following goals.
- To immunize **all** (*previously <100%*) infants against vaccine preventable diseases
- To sustain polio-free status of the Philippines
- To eliminate measles infections
- To eliminate maternal and neonatal tetanus
- To control Diphtheria, Pertussis, Hepatitis B infection and German Measles (Rubella)
- To prevent extrapulmonary tuberculosis among children

Related laws:
- **PD No. 996** of 1976: providing compulsory basic immunization for infants and children below 8 years old (*covers DPT, poliomyelitis, and measles*)
- **RA 7846** of 1994: inclusion of **Hepatitis B** immunization for infants and children below 8 years old
- **RA 10152** of 2011: Mandatory Infants and Children Health Immunization Act of 2011 for children up to 5 years of age and inclusion of new vaccines: **Hepatitis B**, **Mumps**, **Rubella**, and **Haemophilus Infuenza type B** (Hib). This repealed PD 996 and is considered the current legal basis of the NIP.
- **Presidential Proclamation No. 6** of 1996: Implementing a United Nations Goal on Universal Immunity by 1990; and **designating Wednesdays as Immunization day**.
## Vaccine Types
Immunization may be **active** (with the immune system) or **passive** (gained from someone else), and **natural** or **artificial**, depending on how it is obtained.

|    Type     | Natural                                    | Artificial                                                                                                       |
| :---------: | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Active**  | Exposure<br>Carrier<br>Sick of the disease | Antigens<br>Attenuated (BCG, OPV, AMV, Rotavirus)<br>Killed (Pertussis, HBV)<br>Weakened Toxins (TT, Diphtheria) |
| **Passive** | Breastmilk (IgA)<br>Placenta (IgG)         | Gamma globulin (6 months - 1 year)<br>Antitoxin/antiserum/serum                                                  |
1. **Live Attenuated Vaccines** have weakened forms of a pathogen to stimulate the body to produce antibodies for the disease. This type of vaccine only requires one or two doses to provide life-long protection. Examples include BCG, OPV, AMV, and Rotavirus.
	- Because of its nature, **it is contraindicated in immunocompromised children**, as even a weakened pathogen may cause adverse effects.
2. **Inactivated (Killed) Vaccines** are dead pathogens that also stimulate the body to produce antibodies for the disease. A trade-off of its safety is less effectivity, typically requiring three doses for protection, and requiring booster doses over time. Examples include IPV and wP (Whole-cell Pertussis Vaccine).
3. **Toxoid Vaccines** are vaccines that contain an inactivated form of a pathogen's toxins. It is also safe, but also requires several doses with periodic boosters. Examples include TT and DT. 
4. **Conjugate/Subunit Vaccine**  include parts of the capsule of the pathogen. It operates similar to live attenuated vaccines, but are not as effective. Examples include Hib, PCV, HBV, and aP (Acellular Pertussis Vaccine).
## General Considerations for Implementation
1. Remind caregivers of children to comply with the prescribed schedule of routine immunization.
2. **Previous doses do not have to be repeated regardless of interval**.
3. The eligible age for **Pentavalent** vaccines is **up to 5 years old**.
4. Booster doses are not *really* necessary.
5. **Vaccines may be given on the same day, but in different sites**:
	- If through the same leg, space the site at least 2.5 to 5 centimeters (1 to 2 inches; at least two fingerbreadths).
	- **Start with OPV**, **then Rotavirus**, then the other vaccines.
6. Observe the "**First Expiry, First Out**" (FEFO) or "**First In, First Out**" (FIFO) principle in utilizing vaccine stocks.
7. Use **cotton** in cleaning the injection site. **If with alcohol, thoroughly dry before administrating the vaccine**.
8. **BCG, AMV, and MMR have special diluents**. After reconstitution, **these vaccines are only valid for 6 hours**. *This used to be 4 hours*
9. **Protect BCG from sunlight, and Rotavirus from light**. *This principle may be used in questions that ask which location is appropriate for vaccination*
10. Information caregivers of children for immunization about [[#Common Vaccination Side Effects and Management|common side effects]], and how to deal with it.
11. **Reusable vaccines** such as **OPV, Pentavalent, Hepatitis B, and Tetanus Toxoid** may last for a maximum of **4 weeks** as long as the vaccine has (a) not expired, (b) been maintained in appropriate cold chain conditions, (c) remained uncontaminated during aspiration, (d) a VVM that does not indicate discarding, and (e) the vaccine septum has not been submerged in water.

In cases of a **measles outbreak**, a **supplemental measles vaccine** is administered.
- For children **under 9 months old**, give **MR** (no vaccine for mumps) reconstituted with **two vials of special diluent** (6 mL total), giving 0.5 mL subcutaneously to the child.
- For children **9 months to 5 years old**, give **MMR**.

These are **NOT CONTRAINDICATIONS**:
1. **Fever up to 38.5°C** *"up to" means a fever of 38.5°C still permits vaccination.*
2. **Mild acute respiratory infection**
3. **Simple diarrhea**
4. **Malnutrition** *conversely, this is an indication; malnutrition poses greater risk for disease*

## Cold Chain
The DOH provide recommendations for the cold chain principle of proper vaccine storage, handling, and transport of vaccines in the prescribed temperature. Methods for ensuring biological potency include the following:
1. **First Expiry, First Out** (FEFO) **Principle**: use the vaccines nearest to their expiration date.
2. **Vaccine Vial Monitor** (VVM): a round disc of heat-sensitive material to **register cumulative heat exposure**. The lower the temperature, the slower the color change and vice versa.
	- If the square is lighter than the circle, use the vaccine if not expired.
	- If the square matches or is darker than the circle, do not use the vaccine and inform the supervisor.
3. **Shake Test**: an approach to determine if a freeze-sensitive biological has been frozen then thawed, to determine it for use or for disposal.
	- If the vial is smooth and cloudy immediately after shaking, the biological can be used. If it appears granular and not smooth, it should be discarded.
	- If, after 30 minutes, the vial starts to clear but no sediment has formed, it is viable. Otherwise, an almost clear vial with thick sediment should be discarded.

Vaccines are often temperature sensitive, and therefore should be maintained in their respective temperatures during transport and storage. The **cold chain** is a system for ensuring vaccine potency. This system is managed by the *cold chain manager*, a role held by the **public health nurse**.
1. **Transport Boxes**: for transporting vaccines, with a viable duration of **five days**.
2. **Vaccine Carriers**: a smaller transport box used within the community, with a viable of **two days** (48 hours).
3. **Refrigerator**: a refrigerator used for vaccines is divided between the body (kept at 2°C to 8°C) and the freezer (-15°C to -25°C). The door of the refrigerator is never used due to it being subject to fluctuations in temperature. Vaccines may be stored in these for **30 days**; 1 month.
	- In a health unit, the temperature is **checked routinely at least twice a day** by the cold chain officer, usually upon opening and before closing.
	- Only OPV is kept in the freezer; freeze-dried vaccines do not require freezing. Their special diluents are kept on the refrigerator door or the lower compartment.

| Sensitivity                                    | Vaccines                    | Temperature    | Stability                      |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Most sensitive                                 | OPV                         | -15°C to -25°C | -                              |
| Least sensitive to heat/most sensitive to cold | Pentavalent, HBV, DT Toxoid | 2°C to 8°C     | 8 hours if in room temperature |
| Most sensitive to light                        | -                           | -              | 4 to 6 hours                   |
