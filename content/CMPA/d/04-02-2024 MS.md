# Cataracts
An increase in the opacity of the lens of the eyes. A progressive, painless loss of vision is the main characteristic of cataracts.
## Risk Factors
(mn. CARDDS)
1. Corticosteroids
2. Aging
3. Retinal Detachment
4. Diabetes Mellitus, Down Syndrome
5. Smoking
## Symptoms
- Painless blurring of vision
- White-colored or cloudy lens/pupil
## Treatment
- Cataracts are done primarily through **lens removal**. This may be done with ultrasound vibrations that breaks the lens into fragments.
- Patients without lens are aphakic (has aphakia). Surgical management is through **lens replacement**, which uses **lens implants** or **corrective lenses**.
## Nursing Intervention
- Post-op: monitor vital signs, level of consciousness, and dressings.
- Elevate the **head of the bed**.
- Lie on the **unaffected side**.
- **Eyeglasses** will be given for the patient when discharged. At night, an **eye shield** is used to prevent scratching.
- Avoid activities that elevate the IOP: sneezing, coughing, straining or using the valsalva maneuver (utilize a papaya + high residue/fiber diet) To prevent constipation, **laxatives** may be given. **Antiemetics** may be given for vomiting patients. Increased IOP may cause hemorrhaging.
- Priority after surgery: **safety**. Set siderails.
___
# Glaucoma
**Increased IOP** (normal: 10 to 21 mmHg) due to an imbalance in the **production and drainage of aqueous humor**.
## Symptoms
1. **Open Angle Glaucoma**: loss of peripheral vision (tunnel vision), where halos are seen when around lights.
2. **Closed Angle Glaucoma**: headache and eye pain present due to higher IOP compared to open angle.
## Risk Factors
1. **Smoking**, **Steroids**
2. **Aging**
3. **Diabetes Mellitus**
## Diagnostic Examination
1. **History**
2. **Tonometry** through a tonometer, which measures IOP
## Nursing Intervention
1. Priority Nursing Diagnosis: **risk for injury** due to sensory impairment; ensure safety.
2. Keep lights open to promote pupil constriction. Dark environments allow for dilation, and increase IOP.
## **Treatment**
1. **Miotics**: drugs that constrict the pupil. **Pilocarpine**
2. **Topical Beta-Blockers** instilled at the lower conjunctiva; **betaxolol**, **timolol**. Always monitor heart rate to check for bradycardia. Trivia: only 7% of eye drops enter systemic circulation.
3. **Prostaglandin Analogs**: **travoprost**, **latanoprost**
4. **Surgical Management**: iridectomy, iridotomy used to facilitate aqueous drainage.
___
# Retinal Detachment
The separation of the choroid from the retina, forming a retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) detached from the sensory layer.
## Causes
1. Diabetic retinopathy
2. Aphakia
3. Tumor of the eye
4. Inflammation of the eye: uvitis (middle layer inflammation)
5. High myopia
## Symptoms
1. **Flashes** of light and sight of **floaters** (light spots on the foreground of one's sight)
2. Sense of a **curtain** being drawn over the eye.
3. **Painless blurring** of vision.
## Treatment
1. **Scleral buckle**, which promote reattachment of the choroid to the senosry retina.
2. **Pneumatic retinopexy**, where the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is pushed into the retina via the administration of gas bubbles or silicone oil into the vitreous cavity.
	- Importantly, position the patient **PRONE** after surgery to position the gas bubble properly in pushing the RPE to the retina.
	- Avoid activities that increases IOP: sneezing, coughing, straining/valsalva, vomiting (use antiemetics), constipation (use high fiber/high residue + papaya diet, or laxatives as ordered)
___
# Ear Disorders
1. **External Ear**: ear canal
	- Erythematous ear canal; **otitis externa**, inflammation of the ear canal.
	- The ear canal is normally skin colored. If inflamed, it is erythematous.
	- Aural tenderness occurs, where manipulation of the pinna, oracle, or canal causes pain.
	- Treatment: **analgesics** (otic drops)
2. **Middle Ear**: tympanic membrane, eustachian tube (connects the ear to the nasopharynx), malleus, indus, stapes.
	- Problems with the external or middle ear that results in hearing loss is **conductive hearing loss**
	- In **otitis media**, the tympanic membrane bulges and becomes erythematous (normally pearly grey).
	- A consequence of **URTIs** travelling through the eustachian tube.
3. **Inner Ear**: a.k.a. labyrinth; cochlea
	- **Labyrinthitis**.
	- Problems with the inner ear or labyrinth that results in hearing loss is **sensorineural hearing loss**. Often caused by (mn. LMP) **labyrinthitis**, **Meniere's syndrome**, and **presbycusis**.
___
# Otitis Externa
Containing the ear canal and other external ear structures, otitis externa is the inflammation of the ear canal.
## Symptoms
1. Erythematous ear canal
2. Aural Tenderness
## Treatment
1. **Antibiotics** for infection
2. **Analgesia** with otic drugs (ear drops) for pain
___
# Otitis Media
Associated with URTIs (cough or cold). This features a tympanic membrane that bulges and becomes erythematous. Hearing loss associated with this condition is **conductive hearing loss**. If untreated, this may also cause **mastoiditis**.
## Symptoms
1. **Fever**
2. **Ear Pain** (Otalgia), a classic symptom of otitis media.
3. **Ear Pressure**
4. **Bulging Eardrum**
5. **Ear Discharge**
## Treatment
1. **Tympanotomy** or **Myringotomy**: a surgical perforation of the tympanic membrane used to relieve otalgia and facilitate drainage.
___
# Mastoiditis
A complication of **otitis media**.
## Symptoms
The tympanic membrane is described as (mn. DIRT) dull, immobile, red, and thick.
## Treatment
Surgery to remove infected mastoid ear cells: **mastoidectomy**.
- If unsuccessful in removing infected cells, meningitis, dizziness, and damage to CN 6 (abducens) and 7 (facial).
___
# Otosclerosis
Abnormal bone growth at the level of the **stapes**.
## Symptoms
1. Conductive hearing loss
2. Normal tympanic membrane (pearly grey)
3. Often occurs in pregnant patients.
## Treatment
1. **Stapedectomy**: removal of the stapes and abnormal bone growths.
2. Application of **hearing aids**
3. **Sodium fluoride** may prevent otosclerosis.
___
# Presbycusis
A form of sensorineural hearing loss related to aging. Hearing is lost due to age because of degenerative changes (atrophy) of the cochlea. Irreversible.
___
# Meniere's Disease
An inner ear (labyrinth) disorder, where there is an increased fluid (endolymphatic fluid) in the membranous labyrinth.
## Symptoms
- **Tinnitus**, ringing within the ears.
- **Sensorineural Hearing Loss**
- **Vertigo** (most common due to affectation of the cochlea)
## Management
1. **Risk for falls or injury** due to impaired vestibular function; ensure safety.
2. **Low sodium diet** as episodes may be related to high sodium consumption.
3. **Diuretics** to reduce fluid volume
4. **Vestibular nerve resection** to remove vertigo.
5. **Labyrinthectomy**, removal of the inner ear. Permanent deafness.
