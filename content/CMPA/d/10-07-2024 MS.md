# Review of Anatomy and Physiology
The **heart** is the major circulatory organ of the body. It roughly weighs 300 grams and is divided between two general systems:
1. **Left Side**: the part of the heart that pumps blood into systemic circulation.
2. **Right Side**: the part of the heart that pumps blood into pulmonic circulation.

The heart is composed of four chambers and four valves:
1. **Right Atrium**: receives blood from the superior and inferior vena cavae, being the terminal point of systemic circulation. Blood from this chamber passes through the tricuspid valve to move to the right ventricle.
2. **Tricuspid Valve**: the valve connecting the right atrium and right ventricle.
3. **Right Ventricle**: receives blood from the right atrium, and sends blood into pulmonic circulation through the pulmonic valve.
4. **Pulmonic Valve**: the outlet connecting the right ventricle and pulmonary arteries.
5. **Left Atrium**: receives freshly oxygenated blood from the pulmonic arteries, and sends blood into the left ventricular
6. **Mitral Valve**: the valve connecting the left atrium and left ventricle.
7. **Left Ventricle**: the most muscular chamber, as it is the chamber responsible for pumping blood out into systemic circulation.
8. **Aortic Valve**: the outlet connecting the aorta and the left ventricle.
## Blood Pressure
**Blood pressure** is the total pressure used to circulate blood throughout the body. It is calculated with $\text{CO}\times\text{TPR}$ (total peripheral resistance).
- **Cardiac output** is the total volume of blood pumped by the heart within one minute. The normal CO is 4 to 8 liters/min. It is the product of **heart rate** (number of strokes in a minute) and **stroke volume** (amount of blood pumped with one stroke).
- **Stroke Volume** has three principal components: (a) **Preload**, the amount of blood filling the blood during relaxation, i.e., the amount it **stretches**; (b) **Afterload**, the amount of blood left in the heart after contraction, which increases as **resistance** increases; and (c) **contractility**, the ability of the heart to contract.
- These volumes are all connected. In cases of vasoconstriction, total peripheral resistance increases. In cases of vasodilation, blood pressure, cardiac output, and resistance all decrease.
>[!ERROR] Abnormalities
>1. **Hypertension** is the elevation of blood pressure. Treatment uses **vasodilators**, which decrease cardiac output, preload, afterload, contractility, and total peripheral resistance.
>2. **Shock** results in decreased tissue perfusion from decreased blood flow. Treatment uses **vasopressors**/**vasoconstrictors** to raise cardiac output. Examples of this includes dopamine, dobutamine, livufed.

Blood pressure is measured as **systolic** over **diastolic** pressure. Systolic pressure is denoted by the first Korotkoff sound, produced by contraction of the ventricles. Diastolic pressure is the remaining pressure once the heart becomes relaxed and the ventricles refill.
## Heart Sounds
The heart sounds are auscultated with a stethoscope. The **diaphragm** of the stethoscope is best for detecting S1 and S2, and the **bell** is best for S3, S4, and Murmurs.
1. **S₁** (Systole): the sound created by the **closure of the atrioventricular valves** (Tricuspid, Mitral). This creates the iconic "*lub*" part of the "*lub-dub*" sound of a heartbeat.
2. **S₂** (Diastolic): the sound created by  the **closure of the semilunar valves** (Pulmonic, Aortic). This creates the iconic "*dub*" part of the "*lub-dub*" sound of a heartbeat.
3. **S₃** (Ventricular Gallop): an abnormal third heart sound heard in heart failure or volume overload as the ventricles fill rapidly.
4. **S₄** (Atrial Gallop): an abnormal fourth heart sound heard just before S₁. This sound is produced when an atrium attempts to send blood to a non-compliant or stiff ventricle, e.g., in hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, or aortic stenosis.
5. **Murmurs**: the sound blood makes when flow becomes turbulent, such as in valvular heart disease (VHD).

# Valvular Heart Diseases & Endocarditis
Valvular heart disease is any disease in which the valves of the heart become damaged, resulting in the inability of valves to close (**regurgitation**) where blood can flow backwards and impair circulation. This may also result in **stenosis**, where valves fail to open completely, limiting throughput. Both of these cause turbulent blood flow, which can be detected as **murmurs** auscultated with the bell of the stethoscope.

| Disorder                  | Sound & Character            |  Murmur   |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------- | :-------: |
| **Mitral Stenosis**       | Rumbling; Low Pitch          | Diastolic |
| **Aortic Regurgitation**  | Blowing; Wide Pulse Pressure | Diastolic |
| **Mitral Regurgitation**  | Blowing; High Pitch          | Systolic  |
| **Aortic Stenosis**       | Harsh                        | Systolic  |
| **Mitral Valve Prolapse** | Systolic Click               | Systolic  |
>[!INFO] Murmur Types
>Murmurs may be considered as **diastolic murmurs**— murmurs heard during diastole, or **systolic murmurs**— murmurs heard during systole. Additionally, a **systolic click** is found in mitral valve prolapse (MVP).

Monitor heart sounds, cardiac output, and signs of endocarditis. A **2D ECHO** can be used to monitor the heart's valvular structures and its contractions (ejection fraction). **Surgical valve replacement** may be done. Afterwards, **anticoagulants** are used to prevent thrombus formation.
>[!DRUG] Anticoagulants
>This is a class of drugs that prevent the formation of blood clots. These include common examples such as **heparin**, **warfarin**, and **enoxaparin**. Other types of anticoagulants include:
>- **Oral antithrombin inhibitors** (Dabigatran)
>- **Novel** (new) **oral anticoagulants** (NOACs) such as Apixaban, Edoxaban, Rivaroxaban
>
>Antidotes are used when bleeding related to anticoagulant use occurs. Normally, **Protamine sulfate** is used as an antidote for **heparin** (monitor PTT when in use) and **Vitamin K** is used for **warfarin** (monitor PT and INR when in use).

A common complication of VHDs is **endocarditis**. This is often caused by ***streptococcus viridans*** (normal gingival flora) and ***staphylococcus aureus***. If endocarditis occurs, **==Penicillin G==** is the drug of choice as an antibiotic.
- As *S. viridans* is a major cause of native valve endocarditis, the patient teaching prioritized is to **avoid vigorous brushing** and to utilize an **electric toothbrush** rather than a manual one.
- As with all infection-prone diseases, **maintain aseptic technique**, especially when handling highly invasive contraptions such as central lines.
- Valvular heart disease is **highly embolic**. Among its severe complications are **cerebral embolisms**. Other visible manifestations such as **Roth spots**, **Janeway lesions**, and **Osler nodes** all manifest secondary to emboli. The patient should wear **anti-embolic stockings** if possible.
>[!WARNING] Embolus
>Potential emboli are **not massaged  or manipulated** to avoid dislodging them. A free-roaming embolus may become an pulmonary embolism or worse.

___
# Pericarditis
An inflammation of the pericardial sac, a covering of the heart.
1. **Etiology**: viral infection, Dressler's syndrome (post-MI), neoplasms, renal failure, radiation, and connective tissue diseases.
2. **Clinical Findings**: **pain aggravated by inspiration** is the most common symptom, and **relieved with sitting or leaning forward** (*this differentiates it from MI*). Infection results in leukocytosis, fever, and malaise.
	- A common sign of pericarditis is a **pericardial friction rub** upon auscultation.
	- ECG shows **ST elevation**.
3. **Nursing Diagnoses**:
	- **Pain**
	- Risk of Decreased Cardiac Output
	- Risk of Ineffective Breathing related to Pain
4. **Management**: treat the cause of the pericarditis.
	- **Pain**: NSAIDs, analgesics
	- Monitoring for **cardiac tamponade**: diminished heart sounds, **jugular venous distention**, pulsus paradoxus, narrowed pulse pressure
5. **Medical Treatment**: **pericardiocentesis**, aspiration of the pericardial contents if pericardial effusion occurs; **dialysis** is used if renal failure is the cause of pericarditis (uremia).
## Pericardial Effusion
The pericardial sac normally only contains **~20 mL of fluid**. In cases of inflammation, infection, or other disease processes, this fluid can accumulate and result in **pericardial effusion**. In severe cases, large volumes of fluid can cause **cardiac tamponade**. Heart sounds can become diminished, and a pericardial friction rub  may be heard.
___
# Heart Failure
**Heart  failure** is the loss of function of the heart, being unable to pump blood out into pulmonic (right-sided) or systemic circulation (left-sided).
1. **Etiology**: myocardial infarction, incompetent valves, cardiomyopathy (or any other disorders that affect the muscular layer of the heart).
2. **Right-Sided Heart Failure** (RSHF) features a **distended neck vein** (backing up of the SVC), **edema** (congestion of systemic circulation), **hepatomegaly** (backing up of the IVC), and **jaundice**.
	- **Diet**: low Na<sup>+</sup>, fluid limitation
3. **Left-Sided Heart Failure** (LSHF) features **pink frothy sputum**, crackles, orthopnea (positional dyspnea), and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea from congestion of pulmonic circulation.
4. **Diagnostic Evaluation**:
	- **CXR** to visualize cardiomegaly
	- **2D ECHO** to evaluate **decrease in ejection fraction** (proportion of blood volume pumped out of the heart with each stroke) and **increased CVP** (for RSHF)
5. **Management**: mn. 3Ds
	- **Diuretics** to reduce pulmonary congestion. These include loop diuretics (Furosemide, Bumetanide) which lower serum potassium. Determine potential potassium imbalance in patients taking diuretics. The same caution is applied with potassium-sparing diuretics, which can result in hyperkalemia instead.
	- **Vasodilators** reduce total systemic resistance, allowing the heart to pump better by reducing the preload.
	- **Digoxin**, an inotropic, improves the contractility of the heart.
>[!WARNING] Digoxin
>The therapeutic window of Digoxin is narrow, making it prone to toxicity. In normal use, it should remain between **0.5 to 2.0 ng/mL**. Potassium is also a consideration for digoxin therapy— the receptors for digoxin are also receptors for potassium. If the patient has **low potassium**, the amount of open receptors for digoxin is greater, and poses a higher risk for toxicity than in normal patients.
>
>Its **signs of toxicity** include:
>- Anorexia, Nausea and Vomiting
>- Blurred vision, green halos
>- Bradycardia

6. **Nursing Management**: monitor the client's **weight daily**. A sign of failing circulation is the onset of edema, which results in sudden weight gain.
	- Decrease the heart's workload; provide periods of rest with any activity.
	- Position the client in a semi-fowler's or orthopneic position to facilitate breathing and circulation.
___
# Coronary Artery Diseases
The aorta branches off into the **right coronary artery** and **left coronary artery**. The main problem involved with coronary artery diseases is **atherosclerosis**. It is the hardening or stenosis of vasculatures as a result of the build-up of plaque, and results in decreased perfusion. An imbalance between oxygen demand and supply produces **ischemia**, which can be visualized as ST depression in an ECG, which can eventually result in **myocardial infarction**, which can be visualized as ST elevation in an ECG.

## Angina Pectoris
**Angina pectoris** is chest pain caused by hypoxia of the cardiac muscles. The pain is a substernal pain radiating to the left arm. There are different types of angina:
1. **Stable Angina**: angina produced by **exertion**, and relieved by rest or the use of nitrates (nitroglycerin). The pain is **predictable** and **consistent**.
2. **Unstable Angina**: angina that cannot be relieved by rest and nitrates, and **progresses** in severity and frequency. It is also known as a *pre-infarction angina*.
3. **Variant/Prinzmetal's Angina**: angina that appears most frequently during rest, caused by **vasospasm**.
>[!DRUG] Medications for Angina
>1. **Nitrates**: a vasodilator that reduces preload and afterload— commonly **nitroglycerin**. It is given at most three times every five minutes. It is delivered sublingually via spray or transdermally via patch. Nitroglycerin is photosensitive (place them in an amber container) and expire within six months.
>2. **Beta-Blockers** (-olols) (produces wheezing; given in caution to patients with COPD and asthma)
>3. **Calcium Channel Blockers** (-dipines, Verapamil, Diltiazem) (produces edema)
>4. **Antiplatelets** inhibit the aggregation of platelets. This is primarily **aspirin**, but can also be clopidogrel (Plavix) or dipyrimadole. Because of its nature, monitor the patient for bleeding.
>5. **Anticoagulants** as discussed earlier. Bleeding is also managed.
>6. **Analgesics** are used due to the pain experienced by the client. In myocardial infarction, **morphine** is used.

## Myocardial Infarction
The death of the myocardial layer of the heart, most commonly caused by coronary artery disease. This is known as a **heart attack**.
1. **Risk Factors**: non-modifiables such as race, age, gender; and modifiables (mn. SAHOD) smoking, (a) high chlosterol, hypertension, obesity, diabetes mellitus
	- **Dyslipidemia** is an abnormal level of lipids in the blood. Normally, total cholesterol should remain under 200 mg/dL, triglycerides should remain under 150 mg/dL, and LDLs should remain under 100 mg/dL. HDLs, the "*good cholesterol*", should be above 40 mg/dL.
2. **Clinical Manifestations**: the main manifestation is **crushing, substernal pain** that may radiate to the jaw, neck, or left arm, which cannot be relieved by rest or nitroglycerine. Impaired perfusion results in **cold, clammy skin**; **anxiety** and **a sense of impending doom**; **restlessness**; and **diaphoresis**.
3. **Diagnostic Examination**:
	- **ECG**: an **ST Elevation** in an ECG reading is characteristic of myocardial infarction. Prior to injury, **ischemia** produces **T-wave inversion** and after injury, **necrosis** produces **abnormal Q waves**.
	- **Blood Tests**: **Troponin T, I** (MI-specific), **CKMB**, **Myoglobin** (earliest), and **Lactate Dehydrogenase** (LDH; late to appear).

4. **Management**: the **MONA** mnemonic (Morphine, Oxygen, Nitroglycerine, Aspirin) is [apparently outdated](https://onlinecjc.ca/article/S0828-282X(15)01566-4/fulltext), with only **aspirin** as remaining relevant and clearly beneficial for treatment. Aspirin is part of the **reperfusion therapy** necessary for recovering homeostasis in the coronary arteries. These include **thrombolytics** such as **streptokinase**. As usual, monitor for bleeding when using medications that reduce the clotting ability of the blood.
	- If using morphine, **Naloxone** (Narcan) should be prepared in case of oversedation.
	- The nurse assists in **percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty** (PTCA), where a balloon or stent opens up an occluded blood vessel and **coronary artery bypass graft** (CABG) surgery where an extra blood vessel (either saphenous vein, internal mammary artery, or radial artery) is used to bypass the occluded artery
>[!INFO] Patient Teaching
>Preoperatively, teach the client about the importance of avoiding **vigorous coughing**, performing **leg exercises** (embolus prophylaxis), and exercising **incentive spirometry** to maintain lung function. Postoperatively, monitor the client for signs of infection.

5. **Complications**:
	- **Cardiogenic shock**
	- **Arrhythmia**: ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation— treated with defibrillation, except for ventricular tachycardia with pulse.
	- **Recurrent chest discomfort**
