# Review of Anatomy and Physiology
The **heart** is the major circulatory organ of the body. It roughly weighs 300 grams and is divided between two general systems:
1. **Left Side**: the part of the heart that pumps blood into systemic circulation.
2. **Right Side**: the part of the heart that pumps blood into pulmonic circulation.

The heart is composed of four chambers and four valves:
1. **Right Atrium**: receives blood from the superior and inferior vena cavae, being the terminal point of systemic circulation. Blood from this chamber passes through the tricuspid valve to move to the right ventricle.
2. **Tricuspid Valve**
3. **Right Ventricle**: receives blood from the right atrium, and sends blood into pulmonic circulation through the pulmonic valve.
4. **Pulmonic Valve**
5. **Left Atrium**: receives freshly oxygenated blood from the pulmonic arteries, and sends blood into the left ventricular
6. **Mitral Valve**
7. **Left Ventricle**: the most muscular chamber, as it is the chamber responsible for pumping blood out into systemic circulation.
8. **Aortic Valve**
>[!error] Regurgitation and Stenosis
>The inability of valves to close results in **regurgitation**, where blood flows backwards and impaired circulation. **Stenosis** is the opposite, where valves fail to open completely, limiting throughput. Both of these cause turbulent blood flow, which can be detected as **murmurs** auscultated with the bell of the stethoscope.
## Blood Pressure
**Blood pressure** is the total pressure used to circulate blood throughout the body. It is calculated with $\text{CO}\times\text{TPR}$ (total peripheral resistance).
- **Cardiac output** is the total volume of blood pumped by the heart within one minute. It is the product of **heart rate** (number of strokes in a minute) and **stroke volume** (amount of blood pumped with one stroke).
- **Stroke Volume** has three principal components: (a) **Preload**, the amount of blood filling the blood during relaxation, i.e., the amount it **stretches**; (b) **Afterload**, the amount of blood left in the heart after contraction, which increases as **resistance** increases; and (c) **contractility**, the ability of the heart to contract.
- These volumes are all connected. In cases of vasoconstriction, total peripheral resistance increases. In cases of vasodilation, blood pressure, cardiac output, and resistance all decrease.
>[!ERROR] Abnormalities
>1. **Hypertension** is the elevation of blood pressure. Treatment uses **vasodilators**, which decrease cardiac output, preload, afterload, contractility, and total peripheral resistance.
>2. **Shock** results in decreased tissue perfusion from decreased blood flow. Treatment uses **vasopressors**/**vasoconstrictors** to raise cardiac output. Examples of this includes dopamine, dobutamine, livufed.

Blood pressure is measured as **systolic** over **diastolic** pressure. Systolic pressure is denoted by the first Korotkoff sound, produced by contraction of the heart. Diastolic pressure is the remaining pressure once the heart becomes relaxed.
