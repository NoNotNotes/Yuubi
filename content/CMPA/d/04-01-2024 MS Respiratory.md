# Normal Breath Sounds
1. **Tracheal BS** heard at the level of the trachea, characterized as harsh, discontinuous sounds.
2. **Bronchial BS** heard at the level of the bronchi, characterized as high-pitched.
3. **Broncho-vesicular BS** heard at the level of the scapula, characterized as medium-pitched.
4. **Vesicular BS** heard at the level of the lower lobes, characterized as low-pitched.
# Abnormal (Adventitious) Breath Sounds
1. **Rales** indicate elevated moisture in the lungs.
2. **Crackles**, a more severe (coarse) form of rales indicating accumulation of fluids in the lungs. Often observed in pulmonary edema secondary to heart failure and pneumonia.
3. **Rhonchi** are sounds continuously created by secretions in the airway.
4. **Friction Rub** heard from pleurisy and pericarditis, when the pleura rubs against other membranes producing a leather-like scratching.
___
# Pneumonia
Inflammation involving the lungs. Most commonly caused by *Streptococcus pneumoniae* in adults. In children aged 6 months to 6 years old, the most common cause is *Haemophilus influenzae serotype B*.
## Risk Factors
1. Being a smoker
2. Air pollution
3. Immunocompromised patients e.g. AIDS patients, chemotherapy, dialysis patients
## Symptoms
1. **Pathognomonic**: **rusty sputum**, a brownish color created by bacterial (*S. pneumoniae*) pneumonia. Sputum may still be green in some cases.
2. **Dyspnea** and **Fever**
3. **Pleuritic Chest Pain**, pain onset caused by coughing.
## Diagnostic Examination
1. **Confirmatory**: **CXR**
2. **Sputum Test** (Culture and Sensitivity) used for antibiotics.
3. **Leukocytosis** (normal: 5-10k) indicates bacterial infection.
## Medical Management
1. **Amoxicillin**
2. **Azithromycin**
## Nursing Interventions
1. Dyspnea -> Positioning, Oxygen, Suctioning, Deep Breathing and Coughing Exercises, Chest Physiotherapy
## Types of Pneumonia
1. **Community Acquired Pneumonia** (CAP)
2. **Hospital Acquired Pneumonia** (HAP)
3. **Ventilator Acquired Pneumonia** (VAP)
___
# Pulmonary Tuberculosis (Koch's Disease)
Discovered by **Robert Koch**, caused by *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. These are airborne
## Risk Factors
(mn. MOA)
1. **Malnutrition**
2. **Overcrowding**
3. **Alcoholism**
4. **Immunocompromised** or **Ingestion of Infected Unpasteurized Bovine Milk**
## Symptoms
(mn. PLAN)
1. **Productive Cough** for more than two weeks
2. **Low Grade Afternoon Fever**, the pathognomonic sign of TB.
3. **Anorexia**
4. **Night Sweats**
5. **Weight Loss**
## Diagnostic Examination
1. **Screening**: **Mantoux Test**, a purified protein derivative (PPD) sample injected intradermally (skin test via tuberculin). In two to three days, the result is observed. A positive result indicates exposure.
	- Healthy individuals test positive if the skin test returns ≥10 mm of induration.
	- Immunocompromised individuals (HIV) test positive with only ≥5 mm.
2. **Confirmatory**: **Sputum Culture**, or **GeneXpert** (uses sputum sample)
3. **Determine Extent of Lesions**: **CXR** (mild, moderately advanced, far advanced)
## Medical Management
(mn. RIPES) used for 6 months.
1. **Rifampicin**: red-orange secretions
	- **Contact lenses** can be stained if worn by the patients. Recommend the use of eyeglasses.
2. **Isoniazin** (INH): results in peripheral neuritis, producing numbness or paresthesia. Requires **Pyridoxine** (Vitamin B6) to offset numbness.
3. **Pyrazinamide**: increases **uric acid** ergo avoided for patients with gouty arthritis
4. **Ethambutol**: causes **optic neuritis**; blurring vision. Color discrimination, especially green from orange, is affected.
5. **Streptomycin**: IM ANST; (mn. SON) **sensorineural hearing loss**. The drug is **ototxic** and **nephrotoxic** (check creatinine).
___
# Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases
Always teach the patient about **pursed lip breathing**, which prevents air trapping. Exhalation is extended longer than inhalation.
## Risk Factors
1. Smoking, Air Pollution
## Chronic Bronchitis
**Chronic Bronchitis**: *blue boater*; problems with the constriction of airway due to inflammation, which also increases mucus production due to mucus gland growth.
### Symptoms
- **Coughing for more than three months for two consecutive years**.
- 
- **ABG**: respiratory acidosis
- Nursing Management: **Low inflow O2** (less than 6) to prevent the loss of the hypoxic drive.
### Management
(mn. CAMB)
1. **Corticosteroids**
2. **Antimicrobials**
3. **Mucolytics/Expectorants**
4. **Bronchodilators**: Salbutamol, Ventril; avoid **stimulants** because of palpitation as a side effect.
- **STOP SMOKING**
## Emphysema
**Emphysema**: *pink puffer*; problems with (mn. IBA) **inelasticity of alveoli**, **barrel chest** (increased anteroposterior chest diameter due to air trapping), and **air trapping**. Highly related to smoking.
### Risk Factors
1. Smoking
2. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency
3. Air Pollution
### Signs and Symptoms
1. **Productive Cough**
2. **Dyspnea** at rest
3. **Rales, Crackles, Rhonchi**
4. **Barrel Chest** d/t **Air Trapping**
### Diagnostic Examination
1. **ABG** (resp. acidosis)
2. **CXR**
3. Spirometry Testing
### Management
(mn. FLA, CAMB)
1. **Force Fluids**
2. **Low Inflow O2** (2 to 4 L/min, prevent loss of hypoxic drive)
3. **Administer medications** as ordered
4. **Corticosteroids**
5. **Antibiotics** of pneumonia appears
6. **Mucolytic**/**Expectorants**
7. **Bronchodilators**
___
# Bronchial Asthma
A reversible inflammatory lung condition due to hypersensitivity to allergens. Bronchoconstriction occurs (treated with bronchodilator)
## Risk Factors
1. **Family History**
## Symptoms
1. **Cough**
2. **Dyspnea**
3. **Wheezing on Expiration** (wheezing on inspiration is stridor, often found when choking)
## Management
1. **High Fowler's Positioning** or Tripod during dyspnea
2. **Enforce CBR**
3. **Administer medications as ordered**: bronchodilators (causes palpitation, avoid stimulants e.g. caffeine), steroids (increases (mn. BNG) BP, Na, Glucose, and decreases Potassium. Feed the patient with banana or avocado)
4. **Metered Dose Inhaler** (MDI), a maintenance drug used to prevent exacerbation.
___
# Pneumothorax
Pneumothorax is the accumulation of air in the pleural space. The normally negative pressure present in the space becomes positive and acts on the lungs, preventing it from expanding.
## Causes
1. **Spontaneous pneumothorax**
2. **COPD** (Secondary pneumothorax)
3. **Catamenial pneumothorax**
4. **Tension pneumothorax** especially from ventilation
## Symptoms
1. **Dyspnea**
2. **Dullness**
3. **Decreased chest expansion**
4. **Diminished breath sounds**
5. **Tracheal Deviation** towards the unaffected side found in tension pneumothorax.
6. **Tension Pneumothorax**, where a hole is punctured by a mechanical ventilator into the pleural space.
## Diagnostic Examination
1. **CXR** reveals hyperinflation of the lungs.
2. **ABG**, especially respiratory acidosis
## Management
1. **Thoracentesis** may be the primary form of management if mild.
2. If moderate to severe, a **CTT** (chest tube thoracostomy) may be required.
	- **Nursing Management**: if a CTT is attached to a water-sealed drainage, monitor **fluctuations** (should fluctuate, otherwise obstruction or re-expansion of the lungs may have occurred) and **bubbling** (should be intermittent, otherwise an air leak may be present if bubbling is continuous).
	- One-way: water sealed 
	- Two-way: drainage then water-sealed
	- Three-way: drainage then water-sealed, then suction system
___
# Chest Injuries
## Rib Fractures
Resulting from direct blunt chest trauma, often from vehicular accident victims. The pathognomonic sign of rib fractures is pain on the site of injury exacerbated upon inspiration.
- Surgery is not required. Ribs unite spontaneously.
- Maintain high fowler's and monitor for respiratory depression.
## Flail Chest
Resulting from direct blunt chest trauma that damages two or more ribs. The pathognomonic sign is paradoxical breathing, where inhalation reduces chest size and vice versa.
