>The health belief model states that health-related behaviors are based on individual perceptions on their severity and susceptibility to potential disease, and the benefits of changing behavior to prevent or reduce the effect of illness, i.e., knowledge of disease alone is not sufficient to alter behavior. The individual must perceive a threat to their own health, and believe a specific health action will be beneficial in reducing the threat.

It is based on the assumption that behavior change takes place over time, and progresses through stages. Each stage is stable and is open to change; meaning one may stop in one stage, progress to the next stage or return to a previous stage.

> Nurse Jessa attempts to identify the possible factors associated with the increasing cases of malnutrition in Brgy. Hintuturo. 

She attempts to derive the risk of an individual developing a disease due to a particular exposure by comparing the occurrence of a disease in a population exposed to the suspected factor. She wants to use an estimate which is the direct measure of strength of association between a suspected cause and effect. Her existing data includes the incidence rates of those who had who were exposed and incidence rate among those who are not exposed. Which risk estimate shall she use?
- [ ] Odds Ratio
- [ ] Attributable Risk
- [ ] Incidental Risk Ratio
- [ ] Relative Risk
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
> [Reference](https://www.nwcphp.org/docs/risk/risk_transcript.pdf) Relative risk (RR) should be used for data sets of two groups: those exposed, and those not exposed. It estimates the causal relationship between an exposure and an outcome; the higher the relative risk, the stronger the relationship between exposure and outcome. It is calculated as the ratio of incidence in exposed populations and incidence non-exposed populations.
>- The Odds Ratio is an alternative to RR when data for incidence is not available, and are calculated from case-control studies. These determine the "*odds*" of a certain criteria increasing the incidence of a particular outcome.
>- Attributable Risk is the amount of risk which can be directly attributed to a criterion, e.g., all cases of lung cancer death rate subtracted by the lung cancer death rate of non-smokers returns the lung cancer death rate of smokers, which is theoretically the amount that can be reduced if smoking ceases.
>- Incidental Risk Ratio (IRR) is the same as RR, but utilizes **incidence density** rather than cumulative incidence.

>[!INFO] Situation 
>Nurse Dan is handling patients with respiratory problems. Tommy has been diagnosed with ineffective airway clearance due to excessive secretions and is at risk of infection from these retained secretions. As part of Nurse Dan’s care plan, the goal is to loosen and remove these excessive secretions from Tommy’s airway.

After listening to Tommy’s lung sounds, Nurse Dan identifies congestion in the upper lobes. To drain the anterior and posterior apical segments of the lungs during percussion, the correct position would be:
- [ ] Client lying on his back, then flat on his abdomen in the Trendelenburg position
- [ ] Client seated upright in bed or on a chair, then leaning forward while sitting, then flat on his back and abdomen
- [ ] Client lying flat on his back, then flat on his abdomen
- [ ] Client lying on his right side, then left side in the Trendelenburg position
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
> The apical segments are the top-most regions of the lungs. To allow gravity to aid in draining the secretions, the position to utilize is with the client seated upright in a bed, then leaning forward, then flat on his back and abdomen.

When documenting the results of Tommy’s treatment, Nurse Dan should include the following details EXCEPT:
- [ ] Color, amount, and consistency of sputum
- [ ] Character of breath sounds and respiratory rate before and after the procedure
- [ ] Amount of fluid intake before and after the procedure
- [ ] Significant changes in vital signs
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>While fluid intake is important for reducing the viscosity of secretions, it is not an essential part of the documentation process.

When evaluating Tommy for chest percussion, vibration, and postural drainage, Nurse Dan should concentrate on the following EXCEPT:
- [ ] Amount of food and fluid consumed during the last meal before treatment
- [ ] Respiratory rate, breath sounds, and location of congestion
- [ ] Instructing the client’s relatives on how to perform the procedure
- [ ] Doctor’s orders regarding position restrictions and the client’s ability to tolerate lying flat
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>It is not a priority to instruct the relatives on performing chest physiotherapy. The food and fluid consumed during the last meal before the procedure is important for avoiding aspiration, improving comfort, tolerance, and effectiveness (fluids reduce secretion viscosity).

When preparing Tommy for postural drainage and percussion, which of the following is a special consideration?
- [ ] Respiratory rate of 16 to 20 per minute
- [ ] Client’s ability to tolerate sitting and lying positions
- [ ] Absence of signs of infection
- [ ] Time of the client’s last food and fluid intake
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>It is important to assess the client's ability to tolerate sitting and lying positions. Pain or discomfort, or other reasons to contraindicate positions should be noted before the procedure. The respiratory rate and absence of the signs of infection are normal findings, and last food and fluid intake is not a *special* consideration.

The purpose of chest percussion and vibration is to loosen lung secretions. The difference between these procedures is:
- [ ] Percussion uses only one hand, while vibration uses both hands
- [ ] Percussion delivers cushioned blows to the chest with cupped palms, while vibration gently shakes secretions loose during the exhalation cycle
- [ ] In both percussion and vibration, the hands are placed on top of each other and move in sync with the client’s breathing rhythm
- [ ] Percussion slaps the chest to loosen secretions, while vibration shakes the secretions during inhalation
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>Percussion uses cupped palms to physically dislodge secretions. Vibration gently shakes secretions loose during exhalation.

Nurse Angel grabs the defibrillator and rush to the room where resuscitation is in progress. A colleague has started CPR and confirms the patient is in ventricular tachycardia. As she begins to attach the AED, she notices a transdermal medication patch on the victim's upper right chest, exactly where she needs to place an AED electrode pad. What is the most appropriate action?
- [ ] Ignore medication patch and place the electrode pad in the standard position
- [ ] Avoid medication patch and place second electrode pad on victim’s back
- [ ] Remove the medication patch, wipe the area dry, and place the electrode pad in correct position
- [ ] Place electrode pad on the victim’s right abdomen
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>Remove the medication patch and wipe the area dry. Using other placements or not removing the medication patch will reduce the electrode's ability to deliver a shock.

It is important for her to recognize which rhythms are for cardioversion, defibrillation or non-shockable. Which among the following is non-shockable?
- [ ] Ventricular fibrillation
- [ ] Ventricular tachycardia
- [ ] Asystole
- [ ] Pulseless ventricular tachycardia
>[!FAQ]- Rationalization
>The only non-shockable rhythms are Asystole and Pulseless Electrical Activity (PEA). Defibrillation shocks the heart's rhythm back into normal rhythm.
>- In asystole, no electrical activity exists, meaning there are no impulses to reset or synchronize.
>- In PEA, electrical activity persists, but the underlying problem lies in the mechanical ability of the heart, and not the electrical activity of the heart, meaning defibrillation would not correct its pumping ability.
