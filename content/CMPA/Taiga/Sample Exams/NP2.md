67. May asks Nurse Nina to explain the reason why PIH occurs. Nurse Nina's most appropriate answer would be:
- [ ] "An increase in blood volume to support the growing child caused an increased pressure in the arteries causing damage to the walls. This led to the blood vessels in the body to suddenly tighten up or get narrower, thus causing the blood pressure to shoot up."
- [ ] "Blood volume is increased by 40-50% in pregnancy, which usually peaks at the 2nd trimester due to an increase in plasma volume. That caused an increase in pressure in the endothelial lining of the arteries eventually leading to vasospasm. Hypertension occurs due to the narrowing of the blood vessels due to the spasms."
- [ ] "The precise etiology revolves around aberrations in vascular homeostasis, with dysregulation of endothelial function and vascular tone modulation being paramount. This intricate cascade encompasses the intricate dance between vasoconstriction-promoting factors and vasodilation-mediating substances, leading to an imbalance favoring heightened vascular resistance and augmented systemic arterial pressure."
