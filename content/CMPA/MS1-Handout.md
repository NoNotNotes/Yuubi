# Fluids
In adults, 50-60% of body weight is water. It is stored in various components, generally bring divided  into ​​intracellular, extracellular, and interstitial spaces. The bodily proportion of fluid in the body and in each location varies with age and sex.
* **Age**: infants have higher proportion of body water than adults. There is rapid growth and metabolism, and infants have higher fluid turn-over due to immature kidney and rapid respiratory rate. The water content of the body decreases with age.
- **Gender and body size**: lean body has higher water content. As such, men have more water content than women, because they have more lean mass. Inversely, women have higher body fat content, with lesser water content.
## Fluid Intake and Output
The average oral fluid intake in a healthy adult is 2,500 mL/day, ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 mL/day. By weight, the standard formula for calculating necessary fluid intake is:
- 100 mL/kg (1 – 10 kg) +
- 50 mL/kg (11 – 20 kg) +
- 15 mL/kg (remaining weight)

In normal equilibrium, the fluid loss of an individual must equal their fluid intake. Therefore, in average, this 2,500 mL/day counterbalancing the input to maintain equilibrium. Fluid loss can occur from various medium of the body, with most fluid being removed through the urinary system. The are fluid loss which cannot be measured or seen, known as insensible losses. These occur through perspiration and breathing.

| Intake              | Amount           | Output                  | Amount           |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------- |
| Ingested Water      | 1,200 – 1,500 mL | Kidneys (Urine)         | 1,500 mL         |
| Ingested Food       | 800 – 1,100 mL   | Insensible Loss (Skin)  | 600 – 800 mL     |
| Metabolic Oxidation | 300 mL           | Insensible Loss (Lungs) | 400 – 600 mL     |
|                     |                  | GI Tract (Stool)        | 100 mL           |
| Total               | 2,300 – 2,900 mL | Total                   | 2,600 – 3,000 mL |
The delicate balance of fluid, electrolyte, and [[#Acid-Base Balance|acid-base balance]] is ensured by an:
* Adequate intake of water and nutrients
* Physiologic mechanisms that regulate fluid volume
* Brain and excretory system
* Chemical processes that **buffer the blood** to keep its pH nearly neutral
## Components and Functions of the Body Fluids
Body fluids are composed of **solutes**, **solvents**, **electrolytes**, **proteins**, and many more. **Plasma and interstitial fluids** contain essentially the same electrolytes and solutes, but plasma has a higher protein content. The two main divisions of fluid compartments contain differing electrolyte concentrations:
1. The **major ICF electrolytes** are Potassium (3.5 – 5 or 5.5), Phosphate (2.5 – 3.5), and Magnesium
2. The **major ECF electrolytes** are Sodium (135 – 145), Bicarbonate (22 – 26), and Chloride (96 – 106).

The presence of these components, or their functions include:
- **Transport** nutrients, waste products, immune agents, etc.
* **Medium** or milieu for metabolic processes
* **Body temperature regulation**
* **Lubricant of musculoskeletal joints**
* **Insulator** and **shock absorber**
## Movement of Fluids
**Translocation** is the **movement of fluid** back and forth, and **exchange of chemicals** from one location to another. It is a continuous process in and among all areas where water is located. The components that move along with the fluid include **electrolytes**, substances that when dissolved in fluid carry an electrical charge; **acids**, substances that release H<sup>+</sup> into fluid; and **bases**, substances that bind with H<sup>+</sup>.
1. **Diffusion**: a **solute** spreads through a solution or solvent, **moving from higher concentration to lower concentration**. A permeable membrane allows substances to pass through without restriction. A selectively permeable membrane allows some solutes to pass through without restriction, but prevents other solutes from passing freely. This occurs **within and between fluid compartments** if the membranes are permeable with the diffusing substances.
2. **Osmosis**
3. **Filtration**: the movement of solutes and solvents through hydrostatic pressure, moving from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure.
4. **Hydrostatic Pressure**: a force exerted by the weight of a solution. This is the driving force for filtration, where high pressure compartments "push" solutes and solvents into lower pressure compartments.
	- A prime example of hydrostatic pressure is at the arterial end of capillaries, where hydrostatic pressure exceeds osmotic pressure and fluids and diffusible solutes move out of the capillary (e.g. oxygen from hemoglobin fuels cells) and the venous end of capillaries, where osmotic pressure exceeds hydrostatic pressure and pulls solutes and fluids into the capillary (e.g. waste products exit cells and enter the blood). 
5. **Osmolality**: the number of osmotically active particles per kilogram of water; it is the concentration of a solution. In the body, osmotic pressure is measured in milliosmoles (mOsm). The normal osmolality of plasma is 275 to 295 mOsm/kg (275 to 295 mmol/kg). This is the reference point for isotonicity of IV solutions.
## Serum Tonicity
Cell membranes and capillary walls separate body compartments. Cell membranes are selectively permeable, and permit the movement of water and solutes through several forces. Higher concentrations of solutes produce more forces that move fluid and solutes from the compartment. %%For example, in diarrhea, more electrolytes are lost than water, resulting in decreased electrolyte levels in extracellular fluid. This results in fluid shifting from ECF to ICF through osmosis.%%
1. In the case of **isotonic solutions**, both sides of a selectively permeable membrane have equal in concentration. Very little osmosis occurs as both sides have the same osmolality.
2. In the case of **hypotonic solutions**: a solution, if lower in osmolality than another, is hypotonic to that solution; for example, IV solutions with an osmolality of less than 275 mOsm/L is considered hypotonic. Osmosis occurs, "hydrating" the cells.
3. In the case of **hypertonic solutions**: a solution, if higher in osmolality than another, is hypotonic to that solution; for example, IV solutions with an osmolality of more than 295 mOsm/L is considered hypertonic. Osmosis occurs, "dehydrating" the cells.
4. **Osmotic pressure** is produced by the concentration of solutes in a solution. These are the "fighting" pressures across a semipermeable membranes.
5. **Active transport** is utilized by the body when moving electrolytes **against** the concentration gradient or osmosis. Metabolic processes in the cell utilize energy to allow this transport to occur. This includes sodium, potassium, calcium, iron, and hydrogen; some of the sugars, and the amino acids.
## Regulatory Systems
Under normal conditions, the following mechanisms regulate normal fluid volume and electrolyte concentrations:
1. **Osmoreceptors**: specialized neurons in the hypothalamus that are highly sensitive to **serum osmolality** (decrease in blood volume by 10%, systolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg, and underfilling of the right atrium). These neurons stimulate the hypothalamus when osmolality becomes increased, producing:
	- **ADH** and releasing them through the posterior pituitary gland to increase serum dilution. When decreased, ADH is inhibited to reduce serum volume.
	- **Thirst** to promote increased fluid intake. It generally triggers once ECF volume decreases by approximately 700 mL (2% of body weight). It is also sensitive to changes in blood volume and blood pressure through the info relayed by **baroreceptors** (stretch receptors in the right atrium).
2. **Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System** (RAAS): a sequence of enzyme production
```mermaid

```
3. **Natriuretic Peptides**: hormone-like substances that act in opposition to the RAAS. These are released from the overstretching of atrial and ventricular walls depending on venous return. Its effects act to reduce fluid volume: (a) **potent diuresis**, (b) **sodium wasting**, (c) **thirst inhibition**, and (d) **inhibition of renin, aldosterone, and ADH**. There are three types of NPs:
	* **Atrial NP**: released when the heart’s atrial muscle distend.
	* **Brain NP**: released when the ventricles of the heart distend.
	* **C-type NP**: brain (?).
4. **Gastrointestinal Regulation**: the GIT absorbs food and water through passive and active transport of electrolytes, water, and solutions. These aid in the fluid balance for the body.
5. **Osmosis**: the movement of **liquid or solvent** across a semipermeable membrane from a **lesser concentration to a higher concentration**. The force a solution produces for this to occur is called its **osmotic pressure**. A specific type of osmotic pressure, **colloidal osmotic pressure** (**onctic pressure**) is medically relevant as the pressure produced by the presence of **albumin and other plasma proteins**, as it is one of the main forces that retain vascular fluid volume.
6. **Filtration**: the movement of both solute and solvent across a semipermeable membrane from an area of **higher pressure to lower pressure**. This pressure is mainly from **hydrostatic pressure**– the pressure exerted by the fluids within the closed system. Filtration in the vascular system only occurs once hydrostatic pressure (outward force) exceeds osmotic pressure (inward force).
7. **Diffusion**: the movement of **particles, solutes, molecules** from an area of **higher concentration to an area of a lower concentration** through a semipermeable membrane. Its rate depends on the size of the molecules (larger particles are slower), concentration (wider difference in concentration diffuses faster), and temperature (higher temperature permits faster diffusion).
8. **Active Transport** is a form of **facilitated diffusion**, which is an “*uphill movement*” of solutes from **lower concentration to higher concentration** using energy (ATP).

# Electrolytes
**Electrolytes** are substances present on ICF and ECF that carry electrical charge. Depending on the energy charge of the ion, they may be categorized as **cations** (positive ions) and **anions** (negative ions). In a human, electrolytes are obtained from food, fluids, medications, intravenous fluids, and TPN solutions.

| Electrolytes | Reference Serum Range |
| :----------- | :-------------------- |
| Sodium       | 135 – 145             |
| Potassium    | 3.5 – 5.0             |
| Calcium      | 9.0 – 10.5            |
| Chloride     | 98 – 106              |
| Magnesium    | 1.3 – 2.1             |
| Phosphorus   | 3.0 – 4.5             |
## Dynamics of Electrolyte Balance
1. **Distribution**:
	- **Sodium**, **Calcium**, **Chloride** concentration are higher in ECF.
	- **Potassium**, **Magnesium**, **Potassium** concentrations are higher in ICF.
2. **Excretion**: urine, feces, surgical/wound drainage, pathological conditions
3. **Regulation**: **kidneys**, GIT, **hormones** (aldosterone, ANF, PTH, calcitonin)
## Sodium
**Sodium** (Na<sup>+</sup>, 135 – 145 mEq/L) is the major cation in ECF, and the major contributor of plasma osmolality. Sodium essentially determines the degree of water retention, excreted, or translocated (ECF osmolality and volume). It also plays a role in skeletal/heart muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission.

The **kidneys** are major regulators of sodium, whose function is altered with aldosterone (the salt-saving hormone), ADH, and NP. These hormones are produced it inhibited in response to changes in serum sodium:
- ↑ Serum sodium results in ( - ) aldosterone, ( + ) ADH & NP
- ↓ Serum sodium results in ( + ) aldosterone, ( - ) ADH & NP

>[!TIP] Dietary References
>The average dietary intake of sodium is about 6-14 g/day
>- 1 teaspoon of **table salt** contains approximately 2000 mg of sodium.
>- 1 teaspoon of **soy sauce** contains approximately 1029 mg of sodium.
### Hyponatremia
1. **Etiology**: two main causes of hyponatremia is the **loss of** (fluids containing) **sodium** and/or **excessive introduction of fluid**, reducing the concentration of sodium (*hemodilutional hyponatremia*).
	* Profuse diaphoresis and diuresis (loss of electrolytes)
	* Excessive ingestion of plain water (dilution)
	* Administration of electrolyte-free solution (dilution)
	* Prolonged vomiting, GI suctioning (loss of electrolytes)
	* Chronic Renal Failure (dilution)
	* Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (dilution)
2. **Manifestations**:
	* **Mental confusion**, personality changes result from cerebral edema. This occurs because the loss of serum sodium results in cerebral cells having a higher sodium concentration, pulling fluid towards them.
	* Muscular weakness, as sodium plays a part in skeletal muscle contraction.
	* Anorexia, restlessness
	* Elevated BP, tachycardia, N\&V
	* Severe: convulsions & coma
3. **Management**:
	* Underlying cause is corrected
	* Mild deficits: **oral administration of Na<sup>+</sup>**
	* Severe deficits: **IV therapy**
	* Monitor **I&O*** and **level of consciousness**
### Hypernatremia
1. **Etiology**: two main causes of hyponatremia is the **introduction of** (fluids containing) **sodium** and/or **excessive loss of fluid**, increasing the concentration of sodium (*hemoconcentrational hypernatremia*).
	* Profuse watery diarrhea (concentration)
	* Excessive salt intake without sufficient water intake (sodium intake)
	* Decreased water intake, e.g., in elderly, debilitated, or unconscious clients (concentration)
	* Excessive administration of solutions containing Na+ (sodium intake)
	* Excessive water loss without accompanying loss of sodium (concentration)
2. **Manifestations**:
	* Thirst (increased osmolality stimulates osmoreceptors)
	* Dry, sticky mucous membranes
	* Decreased UO
	* Fever
	* Rough, dry tongue
	* Lethargy; altered level of consciousness that becomes a coma if severe.
3. **Treatment**:
	* Depends on the cause, e.g., give ADH-like drugs (Vasopressin, Pitressin, Tannate) for patients with DI.
	* Oral administration of plain water to counter hemoconcentration.
	* IV administration of hypotonic solution
4. **Nursing Management**:
	* **Early detection**; monitor **I&O** (including infusion rates), **VS** (q1° – q4°), and signs/symptoms. Notify the physician if warranted.
	* Implements prescribed **dietary restrictions** or supplementation.
## Potassium
**Potassium** (K<sup>+</sup>, 3.5 – 5.0 mEq/L) is the major ICF cation (~140 mEq/L in ICF). It regulates protein synthesis, glucose use and storage, and **maintains action potentials in excitable membranes**. Because of its low serum concentration, changes in serum potassium seriously affects physiologic activities; a decrease of 1 mEq/L is a ~25% alteration in total concentration.

The **Sodium-Potassium Pump** maintains normal serum potassium levels by moving potassium into cells to retain normal levels despite heavy dietary intake (2 – 20 g/day).

>[!TIP] Common Dietary References
>- One medium **avocado** contains approximately 1097 mg of potassium.
>- One medium **banana** contains approximately 451 mg of potassium.

	* Assess clients for conditions with potential to cause potassium imbalances
	* Identify signs and symptoms
	* Monitor laboratory findings
	* Administer medications
		* KCl – diluted in an IV solution & administered at a rate below 10 mEq/hr
## Calcium
**Calcium** (Ca<sup>+</sup>, 9 – 10.5 mg/dL) is important for **bone strength and density**, activation of enzymes or reactions, **skeletal/cardiac muscle contraction**, nerve impulse transmission, and blood clotting. It exists in two forms when in the serum: **bound** and **unbound** calcium. Those bound are unable to exert their effects, as their are attached to proteins (albumin).

The **parathyroid glands** are major contributors in regulating calcium through the hormones **PTH** (mobilizes calcium, promoting demineralization of the bone) and **Thyrocalcitonin** (increases deposition of calcium into bone, inhibits calcium resorption). Additionally, **Vitamin D** aids in gastrointestinal absorption of calcium.
### Hypocalcemia
1. **Etiology**:
	* Vitamin D deficiency
	* Hypoparathyroidism
	* Acute pancreatitis
	* Corticosteroids
	* Rapid administration of multiple units of blood that contain an anticalcium additive blood that contain an anticalcium additive

>* Lactose-free milk and nonprescription lactase enzymes are available for lactose-intolerant clients.
>* Take prescribed or physician-recommended drugs as directed; do not exceed or omit a dose
## Phosphorus
**Phosphorus** (3 – 4.5 mg/dL) is the major anion in ICF. Most of it (80%) is stored in the bones. It plays a role in activating B-complex vitamins, in ATP, in acid-base balance, and calcium homeostasis (it has a balanced reciprocal relationship with calcium).

Phosphorus is also regulated by **PTH**, because of its reciprocal relationship with calcium. An increase in PTH increases calcium, thus decreasing phosphorus, and vice versa.
## Magnesium
**Magnesium** (Mg, 1.3 – 2.1 mEq/L) plays important roles both in its intracellular form and extracellular form. 60% of magnesium is stored in bones and cartilage, and more is stored in intracellular fluid for the heart, liver, and skeletal muscles. This distribution is related to its functions:
- **ICF** – skeletal muscle contraction, protein metabolism and synthesis, Vitamin B complex activation, and ATP and DNA synthesis.
- **ECF** – regulates blood coagulation and **skeletal muscle contractility**.

Magnesium is regulated by the **kidneys** and **GIT** though its exact mechanism is not known.
## Hypomagnesemia

	* If giving MgSO4, always check the BP\!\!\! (vasodilation)
		* Antidote: Calcium gluconate (kept available)
	* Monitor vital signs
	* Provide health teaching
## Chloride
**Chloride** (Cl, 98 - 106 mEq/L) is the major ECF anion. It works with sodium to maintain osmotic pressure. It is an important component of **hydrochloric acid** (HCl) produced in the stomach (and is therefore implicated in vomiting). It is an important aspect of [[Unit III#Regulatory Systems|chloride shifting]], an acid-base regulatory system.

# Fluid Imbalance
| Fluid Volume Imbalance | Definition                                                                  |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hypovolemia            | A low volume of fluids in ECF.                                              |
| Hypervolemia           | A high volume of fluids in ECF.                                             |
| Third Spacing          | The movement of fluids into interstitial faces, such as cavities or joints. |
| Dehydration            | A low volume of fluids in both ECF and ICF.                                 |
## Hypovolemia (Fluid Volume Deficit)
**Hypovolemia** is a low volume of ECF. The term may be confused with **dehydration**, which is a low volume of fluid in both ECF & ICF.
1. **Etiology**: a deficit is produced by an inequality between patient intake (lower) and output (higher).
	* Inadequate fluid intake
	- Hemorrhage
	- Prolonged vomiting and diarrhea
	* Wound loss (especially in [[#Burn Injury]])
	* Profuse urination or perspiration
	* [[#Movement of Fluids|Translocation]] of fluid (abdominal cavity)
2. **Pathophysiology**:
	* ↑ HR to maintain adequate CO
	* BP falls with postural changes, or it may become severely lowered when blood is rapidly lost
	* Hemoconcentration occurs \= ↑ potential for blood clots, urinary stones (compromises kidney’s function to excrete nitrogen wastes)
	* Eventually it depletes ICF which can affect cellular functions \= change in mentation
3. **Assessment findings**:
	- Thirst is one of the earliest symptoms of hypovolemia.
	- ​Weight loss ≥ 2 lbs within 24 hours
	- ↓BP, inc. Temp, rapid & weak thread pulse, rapid and shallow respiration, scant and dark yellow urine, dry & small volume stool, warm & flushed dry skin, poor skin turgor “tents”, sunken eyes, clear lungs, effortless breathing, weakness, flat jugular veins, reduced cognition, sleepy
4. **Medical management**: treatment is front by restoring fluid volume and preventing further losses
    - Treating its etiology
    * Increasing the volume of oral intake
    * Administering IVF replacement
    * Controlling fluid losses
5. **Health Teaching**:
	* **Respond to THIRST** because it is an early indication of reduced fluid volume.
	* Consume at least 8 – 10 (8 ounces) glasses of fluid each day, and more during hot, humid weather.
	* Drink water as an inexpensive means to meet fluid requirements.
	* Avoid beverages with alcohol and caffeine. These impose a diuretic effect on the body.
	* Include a moderate amount of table salt or foods containing sodium each day. Maintaining serum sodium also entails maintaining serum volume.
	* Rise slowly from a sitting position or lying position to avoid dizziness and potential injury.
## Hypervolemia (Fluid Volume Excess)
Hypervolemia is an **excessive volume of water** in the IV compartment.
1. **Etiology**: an excess is produced by an inequality between patient intake (higher) and output (lower).
	* Excessive oral intake
	* Heart failure
	* Kidney disease
	* Excessive salt intake
	* Adrenal gland dysfunction
	* Administration of corticosteroids (prednisolone)
2. **Assessment Findings**
	* Early signs: weight gain, elevated BP, increased breathing effort
	* Dependent edema (feet, ankles, sacrum, buttocks)
	* Rings, shoes & stockings leave marks in the skin
	* Prominent jugular vein when sitting
	* Moist breath sounds (fluid congestion in the lungs)
3. **Diagnostic Findings**
	* Hemodilution (↓ blood cell count, ↓ hematocrit)
	* Low urine SG
	* CVP (\>10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) (\<4 cm H<sub>2</sub>O in FVD)
4. **Medical Management**
	* Treat the underlying cause
	* Restriction of oral & parenteral fluid intake
5. **Nursing Management**
	* Implements prescribed interventions (limiting Na+ & water intake)
	* Administering ordered medications
	* Elevates client head, legs, change position q2°, apply elastic stockings.
## Third Spacing
Translocation of fluid from the IV or intercellular space to tissue compartments, becoming trapped and nonfunctional. It can lead to hypotension, shock, and circulatory failure.
1. **Etiology**:
	- ​Loss of colloids (hypoalbuminemia)
	* Burns
	* Severe allergic reaction that alter capillary & cellular membrane permeability
2. **Assessment Findings**:
	- S/sx of hypovolemia *except weight loss*
	* Enlargement of organ cavities (Ascites)
	* Anasarca “brawny edema” – generalized edema
3. **Management**:
	* Restoration of colloidal osmotic pressure (albumin), then diuretics
	* Nursing care combines the assessment techniques for detecting both hypovolemia & hypervolemia.
	* For patient undergoing **paracentesis**, obtain consent, prepare special equipment (paracentesis set), skin test for anesthesia, then set for skin preparation. Also, allow the patient to void because the needle will be inserted 3 fingerbreadths under the umbilicus, in close proximity to the bladder.

# Acid-Base Balance

* Body fluids contain ACIDS \&BASES aside from electrolytes
	* H2CO3
	* HCO3
* Acid and base content influence the pH of the body (amount of H+ in a solution)
* Normal plasma pH is maintained by
	* Chemical regulation (bicarbonate-carbonic acid buffer system) 20:1
		* Adding/removing H+ ions
	* Respiratory regulation: releasing & conserving CO2
	* Renal regulation: retaining or excreting HCO3, production of ammonia, and net section of H+
## Metabolic Acidosis
* There is increased organic acids (other than carbonic acid) or decreased bicarbonate)
1. **Etiology**:
	* Anaerobic metabolism (formation of byproduct lactic acid) \= shock and cardiac arrest
	* Starvation, diabetic ketoacidosis (more common in type 1 DM) \= fatty acids accumulation

3. **Medical Management**:
	* Treating the cause & replacing F\&E that may have been lost
		* Digoxin/digitalis – CHF
		* Antibiotic – septic shock
		* Fluid replacement – hypovolemic shock
		* Epinephrine \+ atropine sulfate – cardiac arrest
		* Insulin (esp. fast-acting) – if DKA
	* IV bicarbonate (severe cases)
## Metabolic Alkalosis
There is increased bicarbonate or decreased H+ ion concentrations
1. **Etiology**:
	* Excessive oral or parenteral use of bicarbonate-containing drugs or alkaline salts

3. **Medical Management**:
	* Eliminating the cause
	* Prescribing potassium (K+) to correct hypokalemia
	* NaCl if there is rapid ECF volume depletion
## Respiratory Acidosis (Acute/Chronic)
1. **Etiology**:
	* Pneumothorax, the presence of air, or hemothorax, the presence of blood within the pleural cavity, often because of chest trauma
	* Pulmonary edema
	* Acute bronchial asthma – bronchospasm, with secretion
	* Atelectasis
	* Pneumonia
	* Drug overdose – narcotics
	* Head injuries – s/t vehicular accident, GSW, falls
	* Chronic – emphysema, bronchiectasis, bronchial asthma
2. **Manifestations**:
	* Client may breathe slowly or irregularly, or stop breathing
	* Decreased respiratory volumes
	* Tachycardia (dysrhythmias), cyanosis
	* Behavioral changes – mental cloudiness, confusion, disorientation, hallucinations (accumulation of CO2)
	* Tremors, muscle twitching, flushed skin, headache, weakness, stupor, coma
	* ABG: ↓ pH, ↑ PaCo2 (Normal to ↑ HCO3)
3. **Medical Management**:
	* Treatment is individualized depending on the cause of imbalance
	* Mechanical ventilation (may be necessary to support respiratory function)
	* IV NaHCO3 if venti\`lation efforts do not adequately restore a balanced pH
	* Bronchodilators, antibiotics, airway suctioning
## Respiratory Alkalosis
1. **Etiology**: results from carbonic acid deficit
	* Anxiety, high fever, thyrotoxicosis, early salicylate (aspirin) poisoning, mechanical ventilation 
2. **Manifestations**:
	* ↑ RR

	* **ABG**: ↑ pH, ↓PaCo2 (normal to low HCO3)
___
# Burn Injury
A burn injury is a traumatic injury to the skin and underlying tissues caused by **heat**, **chemical**, or **electrical injuries**:
* Thermal burns are the most common, caused by exposure to heat.
* Chemical burns are those secondary to skin exposure to acids and alkali.
* Electrical burns are caused by travelling currents within the body. These are the most serious because of damage penetrating into deep tissue and internal structures.
* Radiation burns are the least common. Sunburns may be considered as a UV radiation burn.

Degree of tissue damage is related to:
* What agent caused the burn
* Temperature of the burning agent
* Duration of contact with the agent
* Thickness of the skin

* Immediate initial cause of cell damage is heat
* Coagulation of CHONs in the cells
* Tissue liquefaction
* Electrical burn: internal damage (cardiac dysrhythmias, CNS complications)
## Pathophysiology
1. Within the first 24 hours:
	- **Neuroendocrine changes**:
		* ACTH & ADH (released in response to hypovolemia)
			* Mineralocorticoid (aldosterone) \= Na+ retention, peripheral edema, oliguria
			* Glucocorticoids \= causes hyperglycemia
		* Client eventually enters hypermetabolic state to compensate for the accelerated tissue catabolism (increased O2 & nutrition demand)
	* **Intravascular fluid deficit**:  after a burn, fluid from the body moves toward the burn area \= edema at the burn site. Fluid lost is lost through water vapor & seepage.
	- Ultimately, this affects **fluid and electrolyte status**: fluid shifting, electrolyte deficit, loss of extracellular CHONs.
	- **Hyperkalemia**, **hyponatremia**
	* Anemia (**RBC destruction**): Hemolytic anemia, increased bilirubin, manifesting as icteric sclera
	* **Hemoconcentration** results in inadequate nutrition for body cells & organs

**The physiologic action of the sympathetic nervous system compensatory in a burn injury (early phase):**

* Risk for mortality: 90%
  * \>60 y/o
  * \>40% of TBSA
  * Presence of **inhalation injury** – the inhalation of superheated smoke and particles of smoke (ex. carbon monoxide) results in pulmonary edema and edematous airways.
## Depth of Burn Injury
1. **First Degree Burn**: superficial-thickness wounds
	* Epidermis is the only part injured
	* Desquamation occurs for 2-3 days after the burn & heals in 3-5 days without a scar or complications
    * Ex. sunburn, short (flash) exposure to a high intensity heat
 2. **Second Degree Burn**: partial-thickness wounds
    * Entire epidermis & varying depths of the dermis
    * 2 types:
		* **Superficial partial-thickness** – dermis + upper third of dermis
		* **Deep partial thickness** – dermis + 2/3 of dermis
	- **Superficial partial-thickness wound
		* There is involvement of the upper 3rd of the dermis leaving a good blood supply; wounds are **red, moist**, & **blanched** (whiten) when pressure is applied
		* **Blister formation**: leakage of large amount of plasma from the injured small vessels lifting off the destroyed epidermis
		* **Intense pain** due to exposed nerve endings especially when stimulated by touch & temperature changes
		* With standard care, heals in 10-21 days with no scar, but some minor pigment changes may occur
	- **Deep partial-thickness wound**
		* Wounds that extend **deeper into the skin, dermis** and fewer healthy cells remain; wounds are **red and dry** (because of fewer BC are patent)
		* **No Blister** formation because deep tissue layer is so thick & sticks to underlying viable dermis that it does not readily lift off the surface
		* **Lesser degree of pain** (more nerve endings have been destroyed), moderate edema is present
		* Generally heals in 3-6 weeks with scar formation
3. **Third Degree Burn**: full-thickness wound
	* **Destruction of the entire epidermis & dermis**, leaving no residual epidermal cells to repopulate; wound may be waxy, white, deep red, yellow, brown or black, **hard, dry, leathery eschar** (burn crust). **Eschar** is a dead tissue; it must slough off or can be removed from the burn wound before healing can occur.
	* **Avascular, no sensation**, healing can take from weeks to months depending on the establishment of a good blood supply to the injured areas.
4. **Fourth Degree Burn**: deep full-thickness wound
	* Wounds that extend beyond the skin into underlying fascia & tissues
	* Damages the muscle, bone, and tendons & leave them exposed
	* Wound is blackened and depressed, and sensation is completely absent
## Extent of Burn Injury
How big an area of the body is involved, measured in % of body surface area (%TBSA)
1. **Rule of Nines**: a quick initial method for determining. Its main disadvantage is an overestimation.
2. Special charts & graph (**Berkow Method**)
	* More accurate for evaluating the size of the injury
	* Uses a diagram of the body divided into sections, with the representative % of the TBSA for all ages
3. **Palm Method**: the most practical method employed in patients with scattered burns. The size of the patient's palm is approximately 1% of their TBSA.
## Factors Determining Inhalation Injury or Airway Obstruction
* Individuals who were injured in a closed space
* Clients with extensive burns or with burns of the face
* Intra-oral charcoal, especially teeth and gums
* Clients who were unconscious at the time of injury
* Clients with singed hairs, nasal hairs, eyelids, or eyelashes
* Clients who are coughing up carbonaceous sputum
* Changes in voice such as hoarseness or brassy cough
* Use of accessory muscles or stridor
* Poor oxygenation or ventilation
* Edema, erythema, and ulceration of airway mucosa
* Wheezing, bronchospasm
## Medical Management
Patient outcome depends on the initial first aid provided and the subsequent treatment in the hospital or burn center. Note the life-threatening complications of burn injury: **inhalation injury**, **hypovolemic shock**, and **infection**. There are six goals in caring for burn patients: airway, fluids, infection, pain, infection, GI function, and psychosocial support.
1. **First Goal: Promote Patent Airway**. This is part of the initial first aid, and is done to prevent further injury.
	* For thermal and chemical burns, **running water** is used to neutralize the heat.
	- Observe closely for **respiratory difficulty** (a sign of inhalation injury). If indicated, O₂ is administered, and IV fluids are given.
	* Quick assessment (extent of burn injury, additional trauma – fractures, head injuries, lacerations)
	* Maintain **adequate ventilation**.
		* Bronchoscopy (assess internal airway)
		* Warmed humidified O₂
		* ET should be available for insertion (\*\*or Tracheostomy Tube, if with burns on the neck; to improve circulation and ventilation)
		* If **eschar** is present in the neck area, a **tracheostomy** is indicated.
		* **Monitor VS, ABG, SpO₂**
		* Ventilation
		* Hyperbaric O₂ treatment (100% O₂, 3x greater than atmospheric pressure in a specifically designed chamber)
2. **Second Goal: Initiate Fluid Resuscitation**; to restore IVF, prevent tissue and cellular ischemia, and maintain vital organ function. The parameter for success of this phase is a urine output of 0.3 – 0.5 ml/kg/hr.
	* Fluid replacement regimen is calculated from the time the burn injury occurred.
	* **Lactated Ringers**: alkalinizing solution; Na+, Cl-, K+, Ca++ plus Lactate w/c is converted to HCO₃<sup>-</sup> in the liver (metabolic acidosis)
	* Assist in CVP insertion

>[!TIP] Phases of a Burn Injury
>1. **Shock Phase** (Day 1 – 2)
>	* ↑K+, ↓Na+
>	* Fluid shift from intravascular to interstitial spaces.
>	* Hypotension and hypovolemia occur from the fluid shift.
>2. **Remobilization Phase** (Day 3 – 5)
>	* Fluid shift from interstitial to intravascular (shifting back)
>	* Patient is at risk for hypervolemia
>	* Slow IV drip and monitor vital signs, auscultate lungs, and urine output.
>	* Most telling sign of adequate fluid replacement: **Hct returns to normal\!**
>3. **Wound Healing Phase** (Day 5 to wound closure)

3. **Third Goal: Relieve Pain**— morphine is the drug of choice. In severe cases, doses of up to 50 mg/hour may be used. However, **Naloxone** (Narcan), a narcotic antagonist, must be prepared for use when respiratory depression occurs from oversedation.
4. **Fourth Goal: Prevent Infection**
	* Wound management is the primary concern. When providing care, the nurse wears powder-free sterile gloves to minimize contamination.
	* Body hair around the perimeter of the burns is shaved.
	* Blisters that have ruptured are removed with scissors.
	* Tetanus Immunization is also administered
	* Clean the burned areas to remove debris.
		1. **Open method**: the wound is left uncovered; the "*exposed method*". Cradle nursing is required (support limbs). This is currently only being used for the face and perineum.
		2. **Closed method**: the wound is covered with a dressing. The current preferred method. The wound is covered first with nonadherent and absorbent dressings (gauze impregnated w/ petroleum jelly or ointment-based antimicrobials). Dressings are occlusive or semi-occlusive, made of polyvinyl, polyethylene, polyurethane and hydrocolloid materials as final dressing.
		3. Recent trends in care also include **Hydrotherapy**, the use of water to clean and debride burn wounds. One of its applications include a **whirlpool bath**, where the patient sits within a tub of circulating water. However, this bath should not exceed 30 minutes in duration to prevent hypothermia, infection, and maceration (skin breakdown).
	* **Antimicrobial Therapy**
		* Silver sulfadiazine (Silvadene) 1% ointment – less penetration on eschar
		* Mafenide (Sulfamylon) – DOC, greatest penetration on eschar
		* Silver nitrate (AgNO3) 0.5% solution
		* Anticoat (contains a thin, soluble film coat of silver)
		* Povidone-iodine (Betadine)
		* Gentamycin (Garamycin) 0.1% cream
		* Nitrofurazone (Furacin)
		* Mupirocin (Bactroban)
		* Clotrimazole (Lotrimin)
		* Ciclopirox (Loprox)
	* **Surgical Management** for enhancing healing
		* **Debridement**: the removal of damaged, non-healing tissue. This is accomplished through four means:
			1. **Natural**: tissue sloughs away by itself.
			2. **Mechanical**: tissue adheres to dressing or is detached during cleansing.
			3. **Enzymatic**: topical enzymes are applied to facilitate debridement.
			4. **Surgical**: the use of forceps and scissors for facilitated removal of tissue.
		* **Skin grafting** is the transplantation of skin. It is necessary for deep partial-thickness and full-thickness burns. It is done to **reduce the potential for infection**, **minimize fluid loss** by evaporation, hasten recovery, reduce scarring, and **prevent the loss of function**. The tissue used for skin grafting is sourced from various organisms, classified as:
			1. **Autograft**: the relocation of the client's own skin from other areas of the body.
			2. **Allograft**/**Homograft**: skin taken from a human cadaver may be used to temporarily cover large areas of tissue, but sloughs away within one week. A problem with the use of allografts is supply, and the risk for contamination.
			3. **Heterograft**/**Xenograft**: skin taken from animals. This is temporary, and rejection may occur within days to weeks. When rejection occurs, removal and replacement is required.
		* Application of a skin substitute
		* Application of culture skin
5. **Fifth Goal: Support GI Function**. In burn patients, bowel function is impaired, resulting in ischemia, and ulceration (Curling's ulcer). This occurs in conjunction with the reduced fluid volume in burn patients.
	* Local GIT effect: ↓BF àlocal GIT ischemia àUlcer (Curling’s Ulcer)
	* (severe): paralytic ileus àno peristalsis àabdominal distention
	* Management of the GIT:
		1. The patient maintains **NPO until bowel sounds return**. **Flatulence** is a sign of restored bowel function.
		2. An NGT is inserted for decompression.
		3. Monitor serum electrolytes
	- **Administer Medications**
		* Proton-pump inhibitor (Omeprazole) to prevent ulceration
		* H₂ (histamine) Blocker
		* Antacids
	- Monitor **Intake & Output**
		* Diet to promote wound healing: High protein (CHON) & carb (CHO), moderate fat; also, Vitamins & minerals
		* Patient will eat when bowel sound return to normal (2 – 3 days after burn)
		* If patient is not eating well, a 2nd NGT insertion may be used for feeding.
			* TPN is used for severe cases.
			* D10W (Vamin), a hypertonic glucose solution.
			* Aminosyn – amino acids
			* Intralipid – fatty acids (white) \+ Vitamin in side drip (indirect relationship)
			* Kabiven solution – 1.9 kcal
				* Contains amino acids, electrolytes, dextrose and lipid
6. **Sixth Goal: Provide Psychosocial Support**
	* Focus: assessing the wound & how the burn injury has affected the client’s status
	* **Calculates fluid replacement requirements** and infuses the prescribed volume according to agency’s protocol.
	* Quickly recognizes and efficiently treats **signs of shock**
	* Administered **prescribed analgesics**
	* **Wound care**
	* Helps the client & family to cope with the **change in body image**
	* **Health teaching** (pressure garments, skin care, etc.)

# Renal Disorders
## Diagnostic Tests
1. Urinalysis
2. **Urine Culture and Sensitivity test**
3. **24° urine collection**
4. **BUN (10-20 mg/dL)**
5. **Crea (0.6-1.1 mg/dL)**
6. **Uric Acid (2-6 mg/dL)**
7. **CBC/FBC**
8. **Electrolyte**
9. **ABG**
## Radiologic Tests
1. **KUB (X-ray)**: no contrast is required.
	- Give laxatives
	* Castor oil 30 cc HS
	* Duphalac 30 cc
	* Dulcolax 3 tabs
	- NPO 12 MN
	- Dulcolax 2 suppository
2. **IVP (Intravenous Pyelography)**: a contrast dye is given intravenously. Obtain a history of allergies, especially to seafoods and a baseline of renal function (serum creatinine). At bedtime, give laxative and castor oil. The patient must have bowel movement in the morning, or else a suppository will be given (must be frozen; use clean gloves).
3. **RGP (Retrograde Pyelography)**: a contrast dye is given through the catheter. This is done for clients with an allergy to contrast.
4. **CT Scan of the Kidneys**
5. **Ultrasound of the KUB**
	* Encourage intake of fluid (3-4 Liters), hold urination
	* Client must have full bladder.
	* Post-voiding will also be checked.
		* Normal residual volume in the bladder: about 50 mL
6. **Cystoscopy**: direct visualization of the bladder with an endoscope. This can detect chronic cystitis, chronic UTI, and stones in the urinary bladder. If stones are found, they can also be removed with the cystoscope.
	* Done under anesthesia. This may utilize general anesthesia, to relax the detrusor muscle, and is preferred. If local anesthesia is used, sedation may be given.
	* **Lithotomy** position is used.
		* Causes discomfort at the back of the knee
		* Must put paddings at the back of the knee
	* After procedure, **encourage fluid intake**.
7. **Renal Biopsy** is the most invasive but most conclusive test. A biopsy trocar is used to obtain samples for microscopic evaluation.
	* The patient is placed on NPO
	* Taken under local anesthesia in a prone position.
	* Check PT, PTT: if the client is a bleeder, give coagulants (e.g. Vit. K)
	* As the trocar is inserted, instruct the patient to hold breath (so no movement of diaphragm to prevent injury)
	* After the procedure, apply pressure dressing. Position the patient supine.
	* Apply sandbag (for about 4 hours) at the back of the client to prevent bleeding.
	  * Monitor VS (especially BP); Observe for possible bleeding
	  * Check for gross bleeding on the urine of the client (color)
	  * NPO until 4 hours
	  * Usually gets out of bed after 1 day; pressure dressing must be removed before getting out of bed
	    * Observe site for bleeding
	    * Avoid straining of stool (1-2 weeks)
	    * Avoid heavy lifting
## Pyelonephritis
Acute or chronic bacterial infection of the kidney and the lining of the collecting system (kidney pelvis).
* Acute pyelonephritis
	* Moderate to severe symptoms that usually last 1-2 weeks
	* If treatment is unsuccessful & infection recurs àchronic pyelonephritis
### Pathophysiology
Bacteria ascend to the kidney and kidney pelvis by way of the bladder and urethra: *Escherichia coli* (85%), *K. pneumoniae*, *P. mirabilis*, *Strep. Fecalis*, *P. aeruginosa*, *S. aureus*. These often reach the kidney through **ascending infection**, or **through the blood stream** (hematogenous). These are also known as a high UTI. This results in inflammation, with the kidney grossly enlarged.
### Risk Factors:
1. Instrumentation of the urethra & bladder (catheterization, cystoscopy, urologic surgery)
2. Inability to empty the bladder, pregnancy
3. Urinary stasis, Urinary obstruction (tumors, strictures, calculi, prostatic hypertrophy)
4. DM, otherrenal disease (polycystic kidney disease), neurogenic bladder.
5. Polycystic kidney disease –
6. Women with increased sexual activity, failure to void after intercourse, history of recent UTI, infection with HIV

### Diagnostic Evaluation
  * Urinalysis – **PYURIA**(pus in the urine)
    * Definite test
    * Clean catch, early AM, midstream urine
  * Urine culture – identifies the causative organism
  * Ultrasound, CT scan – determines obstruction un the urinary tract
  * Cystoscopy, IV pyelogram (not done in acute cases) or retrograde pyelogram – demonstrate obstruction or damage to structures of the urinary tract
  * KUB x-ray – reveal calculi, cysts, tumors
  * ↑ Serum creatinine and BUN – impaired renal function
### Medical Management
* Relieving fever & pain
* Antimicrobial drugs
	* Trimethoprim – sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ, Septra) Gentamycin w/ or w/out ampicillin, Cephalosporin, Ciprofloxacin
* Antispasmodics & anticholinergics
	* Relax smooth muscles of the ureters & bladder, promote comfort & increase bladder capacity

* **Nursing Management**:
	* Obtain complete medical, drug & allergy histories
	* Assess VS (T°, BP)
	* Physical exam
		* Determines the location of discomfort & any signs of fluid retention (peripheral edema, shortness of breath)

## Glomerulonephritis
* Occurs most frequently in children (boys 6-7 y/o) & young adults
* Most client recover spontaneously or with minimal therapy without sequelae
* Some develop chronic glomerulonephritis
### Pathophysiology
* Symptoms of AGN appear about 2-3 weeks after an upper respiratory infection (group A β-hemolytic strep)
  * Impetigo (skin infection), viral infections (mumps, hepa B, HIV)
  * The relationship between infection and acute glomerulonephritis is not clear
    * Microorganisms are not present in the kidney when symptoms appear, but glomeruli are acutely inflamed
  * Most believe that the inflammatory response is from *ANTIGEN-ANTIBODY*stimulation in the glomerular capillary membrane
### Clinical Manifestations
* 50% are asymptomatic
* Sudden onset with pronounced symptoms
* Fever, nausea, malaise, headache, generalize edema, **periorbital edema,**puffiness around the eyes

* Mild to moderate hypertension
* Poor appetite, irritability shortness of breath
* Hematuria, convulsions (due to hypertension), CHF, **oliguria**(UO 100-500 ml/day), anuria (\<100 ml/24hr)
### Diagnostic Evaluation
* Dark, smoky, bloody appearance (hematuria)
* Proteinuria
* Elevated anti-streptolysin O titer (recent streptococcal infection)
* ↓ Hgb, ↑ BUN, ↑ ESR
	* BUN initially normal, then rises
	* If BUN is normal, high protein diet since there is loss of CHON in urine; If elevated BUN, low protein diet
* Hyperkalemia, hypermagnesemia, hypocalcemia, dilutional hyponatremia
* Percutaneous renal biopsy – cellular changes characteristic of an Ag-Ab response. This is a definite test.

	* Promotes gluconeogenesis àhyperglycemia
		* Patient is given OHA (oral hyperglycemic agents)
	* Hypocalcemia
	* Immunocompromised àreverse isolation
		* Client is not considered cured until the urine is free of protein and RBCs for 6 months
		* Return to full activity usually is not permitted until the urine is free of protein for 1 month
* **Nursing Management**:
	* Monitor VS (BP q 4°) collects daily urine specimens to evaluate client response to treatment
	* Maintain bed rest especially if BP ↑& edema is present
	* Ensure adequate fluid intake & measure I & O
	* Diet: Na+ & CHON restricted; adequate CHO intake (prevents catabolism of body CHON stores)

    * Vital signs
    * Urine (strain)
  * Diagnosis, planning, interventions

3 MAIN GOALS:

* Improve urinary output
* Relieve pain
* Prevent infection
## Renal Failure
* Inability of the nephrons in the kidneys to maintain F\&E, Acid-base balance, excrete nitrogen waste products & perform regulatory function
* 2 types:
  * ACUTE renal failure
    * Sudden, rapid decrease in renal function
    * Reversible with early, aggressive treatment
  * CHRONIC renal failure
    * Progressive (months to years) & irreversible damage to nephrons
  * Causes:
    * Prerenal – Hypoperfusion; must receive adequate amount of blood supply from the renal arteries (must be patent with no thrombus); must have adequate fluid volume
      * Circulating volume – must be adequate
      * Heart function – pumping action
      * Renal artery must be patent
    * Intrarenal –Renal damage; perfusion is normal, but the problem is in the kidney itself
    * Postrenal –Obstruction; perfusion and kidney is okay, but there’s problem in urine excretion
### Acute Renal Failure
* **Prerenal**– sudden and severe drop in blood pressure (shock) or interruption of blood flow to the kidneys from severe injury or illness
  * Hypovolemic shock
  * Cardiogenic shock 2° to CHF
  * Septic shock
  * Anaphylaxis
  * Dehydration
  * Renal artery thrombosis or stenosis
  * Cardiac arrest
  * Lethal dysrhythmias
* **Intrarenal**– direct damage to the kidneys by inflammation, toxins, drugs, infection, or reduced blood supply
  * Ischemia
  * Nephrotoxicity 2° to drugs (aminoglycosides – like gentamycin; antibiotics)
  * Acute & chronic glomerulonephritisànephrotic syndrome (protein is wasting away); **Cardinal signs:**proteinuria, hypoproteinemia, edema, hyperlipidemia
  * Polycystic disease – congenital, grape-like formation in the kidney; Malaki ang tiyan. Water inside the cysts
  * Untreated pre & post renal disorders
* **Postrenal**– sudden obstruction of urine flow due to enlarged prostate, kidney stones, bladder tumor, or injury
  * Ureteral calculi
  * Prostatic hypertrophy
  * Ureteral stricture – ureter is narrow, can be congenital or secondary to inflammatory process (ex. Ureteritis)
  * Ureteral or bladder tumor
* *Four phases:*
  * **Initiation phase**
    * Begins with the onset of the contributing event
    * Reduced blood flow àATN
## Acute Tubular Necrosis

* Death of cells in the collecting tubules
* **Oliguric phase (less UO)**
  * Begins within 48 hrs after the initial cellular insult (10-14 days or longer)
  * FVE develops (edema, HPN, cardiopulmonary complications)
  * **AZOTEMIA**(accumulation of urea & nitrogenous waste in the blood) àneurologic changes, seizure, coma, death
  * Hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, **UREMIA**develops (uremic syndrome)
* **Diuretic phase**
  * Diuresis begins as the nephrons recover
  * ↑ water content of urine but excretion of wastes & electrolytes continues to be impaired
  * ↑ BUN, creatinine, K, phosphate
* **Recovery phase**
  * Normal glomerular filtration and tubular function is restored (1 or more years)
  * Evidence: Good urine output, Normal BUN, crea
## Chronic Renal Failure

* Kidneys are extensively damaged
* 5 stages:
  * Stage 1 – GFR \> 90 mL/min, but less than 125
  * Stage 2 – GFR 60-89 mL/min

* *Medical treatment of CRF is similar to that for ARF, except the period of treatment is “lifelong” (unless kidney transplantation is performed).*
* Chronic anemia
  * Epoetin alfa (Epogen) is administered rather than blood transfusion (\*\* given subcutaneously)

***Surgical management: (Renal Transplant)***

* Done to prolong life
* To improve quality of life
* The anastomosed kidney will be supplied by the**iliac artery**
* The new kidney rests on the **iliac crest/ileum**

* Preventing infection, avoid others with RTI, immunizations, monitor sputum for signs of infection, proper use of metered-dose inhaler (MDIs)

 

## Emphysema

* A chronic disease characterized by loss of lung elasticity & hyperinflation of the lung
* Most common COPD

**Etiology/Genetic Risk:**

* Major cause:
  * **Smoking**
  * Alpha1\-Antitrypsin Deficiency (AAT)
    * AAT is made by the liver and is normally present in the lungs
    * Function: regulates proteases from working on lung structures
    * If AAT is deficient, **COPD develops even if the person is not exposed to cigarette smoke or other irritants**

**Assessment Findings:**

* Exertional dyspnea – 1stsymptom
  * Shortness of breath with minimal activity
  * Chronic productive cough with mucopurulent sputum
  * Decreased breath sounds, wheezing, crackles

**Medical Management:**

* Meds: Bronchodilators, mucolytics, antibiotics, corticosteroids (limited basis to assist with bronchodilation & removal of secretions)
* Physical therapy: deep breathing, CPT, postural drainage

**Nursing Management:**

* Administer O2 via nasal cannula (2-3 L/min)

## COPD

**Clinical Management:**

* General appearance
* RR of 40-50 breaths/min
* Presence of “Barrel chest”
* Cyanosis, clubbing of fingers
* Manifestations of RSHF (dependent edema)

**Psychosocial Assessment**

* Socialization may be reduced when friends avoid the client with COPD because of annoying coughs, excessive sputum or dyspnea (can lead to *social isolation)*

**Laboratory Assessment**

* Abnormal ABG results (hypoxemia, hypercarbia), Sputum C/S, Hgb./Hct., serum electrolyte levels are examined because ↓ phosphate, K+, Ca++ & Mg \++ reduced muscle strength
  * Three times collected, during the morning
* CXR to rule out other chest diseases & to check the progress of clients with respiratory infections or chronic disease
* Pulmonary Function Test (VC, TLC, Tidal Volume)

**Interventions**

    * Mucolytics \[acetylcysteine (Mucomyst), Guaifesin\]
  * Pneumonia
    * One of the most common complications of COPD:
    * Teach clients to avoid large crows and stress the importance of receiving a pneumonia vaccination and a yearly influenza vaccine “flu shot”
  * *O2 therapy*
    * The need to O2 therapy & its effectiveness can be determined by ABG values & O2 saturation by pulse oximetry
    * Usually, 2-4 L/min or even 1-2 L/min via nasal cannula or up to 40% via venturi mask
    * **Low-flow O2**because low arterial oxygen level is the COPD client’s primary drive for breathing (hypoxic drive)

**Complications (COPD)**

* Hypoxemia & acidosis – due to impaired exchange of gases
* Respiratory infections (ex. Pneumonia) – due to ↑ mucus & poor oxygenation (most common: S. pneumoniae, H. influenza, Moraxella catarrhalis)
  * Due to infection, COPD manifestations worsens due to increasing inflammation & mucus production
* Cardiac dysrhythmias – results from ↓O2 supply to the heart, other cardiac disease, drug effects, or acidosis
* Corpulmonale – RSHF caused by pulmonary disease

 

## Bronchiectasis

* An **abnormal and permanent dilatation of bronchi**& bronchioles
* It results from inflammation and destruction of the structural components of the bronchial wall brought about by:
  * Chronic pulmonary infection (P. aeruginosa, H. influenza)
  * Tumor or foreign body
  * Congenital abnormalities
  * Exposure to toxic gases
* The structure of the wall tissue changes, resulting in the formation of saccular dilationswhich collects purulent materials causing more dilation, structural damage & more infection

**Assessment Findings**

* Chronic coughing (copious, purulent, blood-streak sputum)
  * Coughing worsens when the client changes upon position
* Fatigue, weight loss, anorexia, dyspnea
* CXR & bronchoscopy – reveals increased size of bronchioles, atelectasis & changes in the pulmonary tissues
  * Informed consent

  * Inflammation is confined to one or more lobes of the lungs

**4 General Categories of Pneumonia**

* CAP (Community-Acquired Pneumonia)
  * Illness is contracted in a community setting or within 48 hours of admission to a healthcare facility
* HAP (Hospital-acquired pneumonia)/Nosocomial pneumonia)
  * Occurs in healthcare setting \>48 hours after admission

## Pleural Effusion

* Abnormal collection of fluid between the visceral & parietal pleural & parietal pleurae as a complication of
  * Pneumonia
  * Lung CA
  * TB
  * Pulmonary embolism
  * CHF
* Normal: 5-15 mL

**Assessment Findings:**

* Fever
* Pain
* Dyspnea
* Dullness over the involved area during chest percussion
* Diminished or absent breath sounds
* Friction rub
* CXR & CT scan – shows fluid accumulation

**Medical Management:**

* Main goal: eliminate the cause & relieve discomfort
  * Antibiotics
  * Analgesics
  * Cardiotonic drugs to control CHF if present
  * **THORACENTESIS**
  * Insertion of a CTT (Closed-Tube Thoracostomy)
  * Surgery if caused by CA

 

**Thoracentesis**(Nursing guidelines)

* Explain the procedure to the client
* Reassure the client that he or she will receive local anesthesia. Explain that the client will still experience a pressure-like pain when the needle pierces the pleura & when the fluid is withdrawn
* Assist client to an appropriate position (sitting with arms and head on padded table or in side-lying position on unaffected side)
* Instruct the client not to move during the procedure, including no coughing or deep breathing
* Provide comfort, inform client about what is happening
* Maintain asepsis
* Monitor VS during the procedure – also monitor pulse oximetry if client is connected to it
* During removal of fluid, monitor respiratory distress, dyspnea, tachypnea or hypotension
* Apply small sterile pressure dressing to the side after the procedure
* Position the client on the unaffected side. Instruct client to stay in this position for at least 1 hour and to remain on bed rest for several hours.
* Check that chest radiography is done after the procedure
* Record the amount, color and other characteristics of fluid removed
* Monitor for signs of increased RR, asymmetry in respiratory movement, syncope or vertigo, chest tightness, uncontrolled cough or cough that produces blood-tinged or frothy mucus (or both), tachycardia and hypoxemia

**Nursing Management (CTT)**

* If with the CTT, monitor the function of the drainage system & the amount & nature of the drainage
* CTT works by principle of:
  * Gravity
  * Small positive pressure
    * 300 ml base water, long glass tube immersed 2-3 cm in water
      * Creates a small pressure of 761
    * Suction
      * On a 3-way bottle, on the suction bottle, the glass tube is immersed 20 cm in water
    * 3 CXR will be done – diagnosis, to check placement of tube, and before removal of the tube
    * Best position: semi-fowlers
    * Palpate the area around, if there’s crackling sound, then there is air leak: Subcutaneous emphysema
    * When will the tube be removed:
      * No longer dyspneic
      * No more fluctuations
      * Lung re-expanded on the CXR
    * **Valsalva maneuver**during the removal of the tube (Instruct to inhale deeply, then to hold breath); then apply air-tight dressing (wound heals within 1 week)

 

## Fracture Ribs/ Sternum

* Common injury resulting from a hard fall or blow to the chest
  * Automobile & household accidents (frequent cause)
  * Sharp end of the broken rib may tear the lung or thoracic blood vessels
* **FLAIL Chest**
  * 2 or more affected ribs
  * Complication of chest trauma occurring when 2 or more adjacent ribs are fractured at two or more sites, resulting in free-floating rib segments
* Paradoxic movement of the chest
  * The chest is pulled INWARD during inspiration, reducing the amount of air that can be drawn into the lungs
  * The chest bulges OUTWARD during expiration, because the intra-thoracic pressure exceeds atmospheric pressure. The patient has impaired exhalation
* This paradoxical movement will lead to:
  * Reduced gas exchange
  * Decreased lung compliance, retained secretions
  * Atelectasis, Hypoxemia

**Assessment Findings:**

* Severe**pain** on inspiration & expiration & obvious trauma
* Shortness of breath
* Hypotension & inadequate tissue perfusion 2° to ↓ CO
* Respiratory acidosis
* CXR – confirms the diagnosis

**Medical Management:**

* Immobilize the fractured rib
  * **Rib belt or elastic bandage**is used especially in multiple rib fractures
  * It can lead to decreased lung expansion followed by pulmonary complications (pneumonia & atelectasis)
* Pain: analgesics (codeine), regional nerve block
* Support ventilation, clear lung secretions
* Antibiotics

**Nursing Management:**

* Apply immobilization device
* Stress the importance of taking deep breaths every 1-2° even though breathing is painful
* Assess, monitor the client for signs of respiratory distress, infection &↑ pain

 

## Pneumothorax

* Accumulation of airin the pleural space it can lead to partial or complete collapse of the lung
* **Types:**
  * **Spontaneous Pneumothorax**
    * Most common type of closed pneumothorax
    * Air accumulates within the pleural space without an obvious cause (no antecedent traumato thorax)
    * Rupture of a small bleb on the visceral pleura most frequently produces this type of pneumothorax
  * **Open Pneumothorax**
    * Usually caused by stabbing or gunshot wound
    * Causes the mediastinal structure to go to the unaffected side during inhalation, while it goes to the affected side during exhalation.
      * *Mediastinal Flutter*– movement of mediastinal area from side to side during inhalation and exhalation.
      * If not treated, can cause cardiac arrest.
    * **Tension Pneumothorax**
      * Pressure in the pleural space is POSITIVE throughout the respiratory cycle
      * Occurs in mechanical ventilation or resuscitation
      * Air enters the pleural space with each inspiration but cannot escape
      * Causes ↑ intra-thoracic pressure & shifting of the mediastinal contents to the unaffected side (mediastinal shift)

\*\* More painful than open pneumothorax

\*\*To help with the pain, during inhalation, cover; during exhalation, uncover. Then prepare the patient for CTT insertion.

 

## Hemothorax

* Accumulation of BLOOD in the pleural space
* Frequently found with an open pneumothorax resulting in a hemopneumothorax/pneumohemothorax

**Assessment Findings:**

* Pain, dyspnea
* Diminished/absent breath sounds on affected side
* ↓ respiration excursion on affected side
* Hyper resonance on percussion
* Tracheal shift to the opposite side (tension pneumothorax accompanied by mediastinal shift)
* Weak, rapid pulse; anxiety, diaphoresis

**Diagnostic Tests**(For pneumothorax/hemothorax):

* Chest X-ray reveals area and degree of pneumothorax
* ABG

**Nursing Interventions:**

* Provide nursing care for the with an ET tube
  * Suction secretions, vomitus, blood from nose, mouth, throat
  * Monitor mechanical ventilation
* Restore/Promote adequate respiratory function
  * Assist with thoracentesis and provide appropriate nursing care
  * Assist with insertion of a CTT to water-seal drainage and provide appropriate nursing care

Et Tube – insert 8-10 inches of the suction catheter.

* Turn patient to side every 2 hrs.

**Lung resections**

* Lobectomy
  * Removal of one lobe of a lung; treatment for bronchiectasis, bronchogenic carcinoma, emphysematous blebs, lung abscesses
* Pneumonectomy
  * Removal of an entire lung; most commonly done as treatment for bronchogenic CA
* Segmentectomy/Segmental Resection
  * Segment of lung removed; most often done as treatment for bronchiectasis
* Wedge resection
  * Removal lesions that occupy only part of a segment of lung tissue; for excision of small nodules or to obtain a biopsy

**Nursing care for lung resections:**

* Informed consent
* Explain the procedure.
* NPO at 12 midnight.
* Refer to the anesthesiologist.
* 
* Vagolytic – Atropine sulfate to decrease secretion.
* Anti-histamine
* Narcotic analgesic to decrease pain perception.
* Teach patient deep breathing and cough exercises pre-op.
* POSITION: turn to the unaffected side (segmentectomy, Lobectomy) while to the affected side if Pneumonectomy.
* CTT inserted. Pneumonectomy least likely to need chest tube.

* **Frequent turning and meticulous skin care are important as skin friability increased**
* **Teach clients about the nature of the disease and identification of factors that predispose to episodes of hemolytic crisis**

 

**Hemostasis/Blood Clotting**

* **Blood clotting mechanism involves 3 sequential process:**
  * **Platelet aggregation with formation of a platelet plug**
  * **Blood clothing cascade**
  * **Formation of a complete fibrin clot**

**1\)  Platelet adhesion (come closer together) à2) Platelet release reaction à3) platelet aggregation**

* **Platelet plug formationtriggers the blood clotting mechanism**
  * **Intrinsic pathway**
    * **Intrinsic factors are problems or substances directly in the blood itself that first make platelets clump & then activate the blood-clotting cascade**
    * **Example: Ag-Ab reaction, circulating debris, prolonged venous stasis, bacterial toxins**
  * **Extrinsic pathway**
    * **Outside the blood: TRAUMA**

 

## Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura/Autoimmune Thrombocytopenic Purpura

  * Must be given together with immunosuppressant to prevent destruction by antibodies
* Maintain a safe environment & protect the client from conditions that can lead to bleeding

**Nursing Interventions:**

* Control bleeding
* Prevent bruising
* Provide support to client and be sensitive to change in body image.

NDX: Risk for bleeding r/t low platelet count, Altered Body Image

* Measure normal circumference of extremities for baseline
* Administer medication orally, rectally, or IV rather than IM; if administering immunizations, give subcutaneously (SC) and hold pressure on site for 5 minutes.
* Administer analgesics (acetaminophen) as ordered; avoid aspirin.

 

## Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation

* **Diffuse fibrin deposition**within arterioles and capillaries with widespread coagulation all over the body and subsequent depletion of clotting factors
  * Hemmorrhage (kidneys, brain, adrenals, heart, and other organs)

\*\* Poor prognosis, High mortality

* Cause: UNKNOWN
* Clients are usually critically ill with an obstetric, surgical, hemolytic, or neoplastic disease
* May be linked with entry of entry of thromboplastic substances into the blood
* Mortality rate is high, usually because underlying disease cannot be corrected

**Assessment Findings:**

* Petechiae and ecchymoses on the skin, mucous membranes, heart, lungs, and other organs

  * Inhibits thrombi thus preventing further clot formation, allowing coagulation factors to accumulate

**Nursing Interventions**

* Monitor blood loss and attempt to quantify
* Observe for signs of additional bleeding or thrombus formation
* Monitor appropriate laboratory data
* Prevent further injury
* Avoid IM injections
  * Apply pressure to bleeding sites

Hypertension

* Generally defined as:
  * A systolic BP ≥ 135 mmHg/ or
  * A diastolic BP ≥ 85 mmHg
* New classification (2003) “ Normal adult BP”
  * \<120 mmHg systolic
  * \<80 mmHg diastolic
    * Prehypertension:
      * 120-139/80-89 mmHg
    * Stage 1 hypertension:
      * 140-159/90-99 mmHg

| \-   	No known cause \-   	Associated risk factors: ü Age \>60 years of age ü Family history ü Excessive calorie consumption ü Physical inactivity ü Excessive alcohol intake ü Hyperlipidemia ü African-American ethnicity ü High intake of salt or caffeine; reduced intake of K+, Ca++, Mg++ ü Obesity ü Smoking\!\! ü stress | \-	Due to specific disease states & some medications ü Renal vascular & renal parenchymal disease ü Primary aldosteronism ü Pheochromocytoma ü Cushing’s syndrome ü Coarctation of aorta ü Brain tumors ü Encephalitis ü Psychiatric disturbances ü Pregnancy ü Medications § Estrogen (oral contraceptions) § Glucocorticoids § Mineralocorticoids § Sympathomimetics |

Aldrenal medulla – catecholamines (sympathetic stimulation)

Adrenal cortex – aldosteroneàincreased sodium and water retention

**Causes of increased blood pressure:**

* Increasein fluid volume
* Sympathetic nervous system stimulation
* Increase in peripheral vascular resistance

**Assessment Findings:**

* History (review client’s risk factors for hypertension)
* Physical assessment
  * Most clients have no symptoms; however, they may experience **headaches, dizziness, fainting**
  * Check for Orthostatic hypotension (decrease in BP of 20 mmHg systolic &/or 10 mmHg diastolic when the client changes position from lying to sitting in 2 minutes interval)
  * Tachycardia, sweating & pallor suggest a pheochromocytoma (tumor of adrenal medulla – secretes epinephrine & norepinephrine) oradrenal medulla tumor
* Psychosocial assessment
  * Assess for psychosocial stressors (job-related, economic & other life stressors)

**Diagnostic Assessment:**

* No laboratory tests are diagnostic of essential hypertensionbut several laboratory test can assess possible causes of secondary hypertension
* Presence of CHONs, RBCs, pus, casts, ↑ BUN & CREA indicate renal disease
* CXR reveals cardiomegaly, ECG determines the degree of cardiac involvement

**Interventions:**

* Lifestyle modifications
  * **Sodium restriction** \- ↓ sodium intake from the average of 150 mEq/L to \<100 mEq/L
  * **Weight reduction**– weight loss is encourage if BMI is 25 or higher
  * **Moderation of alcohol intake**– limit alcohol to no \>1 ounce of ethanol (2 ounces of liquor, 8 ounces of wine or 24 ounces of beer daily). Excessive alcohol intake elevates BP and can add “empty” calories
  * **Exercise**– start an exercise program slowly and gradually work up to more rigorous activities
  * **Tobacco and caffeine avoidance**
* Drug Therapy
  * **Diuretics– DOC**for hypertensive clients who have asthma, chronic airway limitations (CAL) & chronic renal disease
    * Mc SE: hypokalemia (monitor K+ levelm assess for irregular pulse & muscle weakness)
    * Thiazide (low-ceiling) diuretics – prevent Na+ & water reabsorption in the distal tubules while promoting K+ excretion
    * Loop (high-ceiling) diuretics – depress Na+ reabsorption in the ascending loop of Henle & promote K+ excretion (ex; Lasix)
    * Potassium-sparing diuretics – inhibits reabsorption of Na+ in DCT in exchange for K+, thereby retaining K+ \[Spironolactone (aldactone)\]
  * **Calcium channel blocking agents**“dipine”
    * Lower BP by interfering with transmembrane flux of Ca++ ion resulting to vasodilation & subsequent ↓in BP (Verapamil, Amlodipine, Diltiazem)
  * **ACE inhibitors**“pril”
    * Inhibits conversion of angiotensin I to II, one of the most powerful vasoconstrictors in the body (Captopril, Enalapril, Lisinopril)
  * **Angiotension II receptor blockers**“sartan”
    * Candesartan, Losartan, Telmisartan
  * **Aldosterone receptor antagonist**
  * **Beta blockers**“olol”
    * DOC for hypertensive clients with ischemic heart disease because the heart is the most common target of end-organ damage with hypertension

# Vascular Disorders
## Aneurysm

* A permanent localized dilation of an artery, which enlarges the artery to at least 2 times its normal diameter
* Aneurysm tends to occur at a specific anatomic sites but **most commonly in the abdominal aorta**
  * Abdominal aortic aneurysm
    * Pulsatile/pulsating abdominal mass – most telling sign
  * Aneurysm forms when the middle layer (T. media) of the artery is weakened, producing a stretching effect in the inner layer (T. intima) and outer layer (T. adventitia) of the artery
  * As the aneurysm grows, the risk of arterial rupture increases

**Etiology:**

* Atherosclerosis is the most common cause of an aneurysm with hypertension &cigarette smokingbeing contributing factors
* Also, syphilis, Marfan syndrome (an autoimmune disease) & Ehlers-Danios syndrome (a rare genetic d/o causes AAAs

**Assessment Finding**

* **Most are asymptomatic until discovered by routine examination or during radiographic study performed for another reason**
* **Steady with gnawing quality abdominal, flank, or back PAIN especially if it’s AAA**
* **With a rupturing AAA, signs include hypotension, diaphoresis, mental obtundation, oliguria & dysrhythmias (s/sx of hypovolemic shock)**

**Diagnostic Test**

* X-ray reveals “eggshell” appearance in cases of AAA
* Standard tool: CT SCAN (determines the size and location)
* Ultrasonography (Abdominal); noninvasive technique that provides accurate diagnosis, as well as information about the size & location of AAA
  * Serial Ultrasound of the Abdomen – series, ever 2 weeks, monthly; to monitor the size of the aneurysm

**Interventions**

* Nonsurgical management: goal is to monitor the growth of the aneurysm (frequent CT scanning) and maintenance of BP at a normal level to ↓ risk of rupture
  * w/ hypertension; treated with antihypertensive agents
* Surgical management
  * Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Resection – excision of aneurysm from the abdominal aorta to prevent or repair the rupture
  * Goal: to secure a stable aortic integrity & tissue perfusion throughout the body
    * Relieve the pain
    * Position the client semi-fowlers
    * No straining of stool
    * Observe the incision site, bottom linen.
    * Encourage deep breathing but no coughing exercises.
      * If unavoidable, splint it and teach to cough with an open mouth.

 

## Peripheral Vascular Disease

* Disorders that alter the natural flow of blood through the arteries & veins of the peripheral circulation
* Most frequently affected are the lower extremities

Peripheral Arterial Disease

* Chronic partial or total arterial occlusion resulting from systemic atherosclerosis leading to deprivation of O2 & nutrients
* PAD of lower extremities is also called “Lower Extremity Arterial Disease” (LEAD)

**Classification:**

* Inflow of obstruction – involves the distal end of the aorta & the common, internal, external iliac arteries (located above the inguinal ligament)
* Outflow obstruction – involves femoral, popliteal \&tibial arteries (below the superficial femoral artery)

**Etiology and Risk Factors:**

* Atherosclerosis – most common cause
* Risk factors includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, DM, CIGARETTE SMOKING, obesity & familial predisposition

**Assessment:**

* Clients initially seek treatment for a characteristic leg pain known as an**intermittent claudication**(usually they can walk only a certain distance before cramping, burning discomfort or pain forces them to stop)
* Presence of **Rest Pain**– numbness or burning sensation often described as a feeling like a toothache, that is severe enough to awaken clients at night located in the distal portion of the extremities (heal, toes)
* Inflow disease – discomfort in the lower back, buttocks or thighs
* Outflow disease – burning or cramping in the valves, ankles, feet & toes
* Loss of hair on the lower calf, ankle & foot; dry, scaly, dusky, pale or mottled skin; thickened toenails
* Cold extremities & cyanotic; pallor occurs when the extremity is elevated
* Palpate all pulses in both legs – most sensitive & specific indication of arterial function is the quality of the posterior tibial pulse (not palpable)
* Note for early signs of ulcer formation

**Diagnostic Assessment:**

* Radiographic Assessment
  * Arteriography – not commonly performed today because this procedure involves injecting contrast medium into the arterial system and can have risks which include hemorrhage, thrombosis, embolus & death
* Segmental Systolic BP measurements
  * Inexpensive, noninvasive method of assessing PAD using a Doppler probe
  * Normally, BP readings on the thigh and calf are higher than those in the upper extremities; with the presence of arterial disease, these procedures are lower than the brachial pressure
  * Ankle-Brachial Index – an ABI of \<0.9 in either leg is diagnostic of PAD (derived by dividing the ankle BP by the brachial BP)
* Exercise Tolerance Testing
  * Done by stress test or treadmill and gives valued information about claudication (muscle pain) without rest pain
* Plethysmography
  * Used to evaluate arterial flow in the lower extremities

**Interventions**

* Drugs
  * Antidiabetic drug
    * OHA
  * Antihyperlipidemia
    * Statins
  * Antiplatelet aggregation
* Exercise
  * Improve arterial blood flow to the affected limb through buildup of the collateral circulation
  * Exercise is individualized for each client, but people with severe rest pain, venous ulcers or gangrene should not participate
* Positioning
  * Positioning of the client to promote circulation has been somewhat controversial
  * Refrain from raising the legs above the heart level because extreme elevation slows arterial blood flow to the feet
  * In severe cases, clients with PAD & swelling may sleep with the affected limb hanging from the bed or they may sit upright in a chair for comfort
  * Avoid crossing the legs and refrain from wearing restrictive clothing which interferes with blood flow.
* Promote Vasodilation
  * Provide warmth to the affected extremity & prevent long periods of exposure to cold
  * Never apply direct heat to the limb(sensitivity might be ↓ to the affected limb: burn injury)
  * Drink adequate fluids to prevent increased blood viscosity
  * Emotional stress, caffeine, nicotine causes vasoconstriction (1 cigarette \= 1 hour vasoconstriction)
* Teaching
  * Relief of pain
  * Regular exercise (walking), but if pain is present even in rest, walking is no longer indicated.
  * Peripheral vasodilators

 

## Buerger’s Disease

* Aka “Thromboangitis obliterans”
* Cause: UNKNOWN
* An occlusive disease limited to the medium & small arteries & veins; distal upper & lower limbs are the most frequently affected
* Identified in young adult men who smoke; cessation of cigarette smoking usually arrests the disease process, but persistence in smoking causes occlusion in the most proximal vessels
* Pathologists look for:
1. Inflamed/scarred neurovascular bundles
2. Neutrophils adjacent to epithelioid giant cells deep inside thrombi

**Assessment:**

* 1stclinical manifestation: claudication of the arch of the foot
* Increased sensitivity to cold, coldness & numbness
* Diminished pulses
* Diagnosis of Buerger’s disease is commonly based on a physical finding of **Peripheral ischemia**leading to ulceration, gangrene

**Interventions:**

* Complete abstinence from tobacco in all forms
* Avoid to extreme cold and prolonged exposure to cold to prevent vasoconstriction
* Treatment: similar to that of PAD

 

## Raynaud’s disease

* Caused by vasospasm of the arterioles and arteries of the upper & lower extremities
* Usually occurs in people older than 30 years of age; but can occur between the ages of 17 & 50 years of age; more common in women
* Etiology: UNKNOWN

**Assessment:**

* As a result of vasospasm, the cutaneous vessels are constricted & blanching of the extremities occurs followed by cyanosis
* Numbness, coldness, pain swelling, ulcers may also be present

**Management:**

* Treatment involves relieving or preventing the vasoconstriction by drug therapy; help relieve symptoms but they can cause uncomfortable side effects such as facial flushing, headaches, hypotension, & dizziness
* For severe symptoms not relived by drugs: **Lumbar sympathectomy**is performed
* Health teaching & education
* Warm water during bathing.
* Do not hold cold food items directly

 

## Venous Thromboembolism

* Thrombus – a blot clot usually as a result of:
  * Endothelial injury
  * Venous stasis
  * Hypercoagulability (ex. Polycythemia)
* Embolus
  * A blood clot air/fat that has moved from its place of origin that can obstruct the circulation in a blood vessel
* Thrombophlebitis
  * A thrombus that is associated with inflammation
* Phlebothrombosis
  * A thrombus without inflammation

 

## Thrombophlebitis/ Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)

* Can be caused by: Prolonged cannulation
* S/Sx: pain, swelling
* No massage *to prevent dislodging the embolus*
* Exercise, ROM, turn to sides/change positions
* At risk: Comatose patients, paralyzed, patients on CBR

**Assessment Findings:**

* Classic S/Sx: Calf or groin tenderness & pain, & sudden onset of unilateral swelling of the leg
* **Checking of Homan’s sign is not advised\!\!\!\!**(pain in the calf on dorsiflexion of the foot) because only 10% of clients appears to be positive from this test
* **Localized edema**is one extremity may suggest thrombophlebitis
* **Contrast venography (GOLD STANDARD),** duplex ultrasonography, Doppler flow studies, impedance plethysmography, MRI

**Management:**

* Drug Therapy
  * Warfarin Therapy
    * Works in the liver to inhibit synthesis of the four Vitamin K-dependent clothing factors
    * Takes 3-4 days before it can exert therapeutic anticoagulation
  * Thrombolytic therapy – directly dissolve blood clot
    * Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, Abciximab (Reopro), Tirofiban (Aggrastat), Alteplase, Reteplase
    * Effecting in dissolving clots or preventing new clots
    * Serious complication: intracerebral bleeding

**Surgical Management:**

* Thrombectomy
  * Most common surgical procedure done
* Inferior Vena Cava Interruption
  * Indicated if there is recurrent DVT or pulmonary emboli that do not respond to medical treatment& for clients who cannot tolerate anticoagulation therapy
  * The surgeon insists a filter device, or “umbrella”, percutaneously into the inferior vena cava trapping emboli in the IVC before they progress to the lungs
* Ligation or external Clips
  * Ligation and insertion of external clips in the inferior vena cava by means of abdominal laparotomy

**Health teaching:**

* Avoid & STOP SMOKING\!\!
* Avoid the use of oral contraceptives to ↓ the risk of recurrence
* Usually clients are discharged on a regimen of warfarin or heparin so instruct clients & their families to avoid potentially traumatic situations (contact sports)
* Watch out for S/Sx of bleeding

 

## Varicosities

* Dilated tortuous veins
* Commonly affected:
  * **Saphenous leg veins**(lack support from surrounding muscles)
  * Also occurs in:
    * Rectum àHemorrhoids
    * EsophagiaàEsophageal varices

**Etiology:**

* Familial tendency
* Incompetent valves (early adulthood)
* Anything that constricts or interfered with venous return (venous congestion or pooling)
  * Prolonged standing, obesity, pregnancy, abdominal tumor
* Thrombophlebitis (may damage the valves)

**Assessment Findings:**

* **Legs feel heavy & tired**particularly after prolonged standing (patient will say that activity or elevation of the legs relives the discomfort)
* Leg veins look **distended & torturous**seen under the skin as dark blue or purple, snakelike elevations
* Feet, ankles, legs may appear swollen

**Diagnostic Findings:**

* Brodie-Trendelenburg test

  * If blood flows from upper part of the leg into the superficial veins à**INCOMPETENT valves**
  * Ultrasonography
  * Venography

**Medical Management:**
* MILD varicose veins
  * Exercise (walking swimming)
  * Losing weight
  * Wearing elastic support stockings
  * Avoidance of prolonged sitting & standing
* SEVERE OR MULTIPLE varicose veins
  * Surgery
    * Vein ligation
      * Veins are tied off above & below the area of incompetent valves, but the dysfunctional vein remains
    * Vein stripping
      * Ligated veins are severed & removed

**Nursing Management:**

* ASSESSMENT: skin, distal circulation, peripheral edema
* Postoperative: nurse monitors for swelling in the operative leg(s) & its effect on circulation
* Nurse can remove & rewrap the roller bandage to facilitate blood flow
* Nurse inspects the dressing for signs of active bleeding
* Immediate post-operative period: nurse elevates the foot of the bed to aid venous circulation to the heart & reminds the client to alternately contract & relax the lower leg muscles
* Nurse helps the client ambulate as soon as possible to promote venous circulation, reduce edema, & prevent venous thrombosis
* When bleeding is no longer a problem, nurse applies elastic antiembolism stockings in place of the elastic roller bandage
* Provide adequate fluid (to decrease potential thrombosis)
* Health teaching: Avoid wearing elastic girdles or tight belts, prolonged standing & sitting with the knees crossed)
