This is only an excerpt of **Ma'am Aurisita Maganis Delos Reyes**'s presentation, revised into a web format/noted down using the outline method. A good exercise to do for review is to re-summarize this information as it was in the presentation, pointing out and organizing key points and information.

I'll supplement information when relevant, but this is **probably not reflective of the comprehensive information provided during her live discussions**. You can find the presentation and the recorded discussions in [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1AEz4QnhFf5cAOq_Twn8UxNavvzm__QiK).

# Essential Intrapartum and Newborn Care
"Essential Newborn Care" (ENC) is a part of Essential Intrapartum Newborn Care (EINC). It is a simple, cost-effective newborn care intervention that can improve both neonatal and maternal care. It is also known as *Unang Yakap* (First Embrace) and consists of four core steps: immediate and thorough drying, early skin-to-skin contact, properly-timed cord clamping, and non-separation of newborn from mother for early breastfeeding. Following this immediate care, six supplemental priorities take place: identification, Crede's prophylaxis, vitamin K injection, immunization, newborn screening, and anthropometric measurement.
## Immediate and Thorough Drying
Within the first 30 seconds, dry and rub the newborn, or until the newborn responds by crying. Drying acts to **prevent hypothermia** as the thermoregulatory capacity of the newborn is not yet stable.
- This action **stimulates lung expansion** and allows the nurse to **assess the breathing** of the newborn. Lung expansion increases pressure in the left side of the heart, which results in the closure of the fetal structures (foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus).
- **Suction the airways** (mouth before nose, to account for reflex breathing, for 5 to 10 seconds) **only if necessary**. Routine suctioning is *not recommended*.
- Afterwards, **position the newborn prone on the mother**. This can lead to an initiation of the **crawling reflex**, a sign of readiness for feeding.
## Early Skin-to-skin Contact
From 1 minute to 30 or 60 minutes, and with the newborn on the mother, place a bonnet over the head (a major portion of heat loss comes from the head) and a blanket for the back. Benefits of skin-to-skin contact include the **transfer of heat, normal skin flora, and love from the mother to the newborn**.
- The period where baths are recommended is **at least 6 to 8 hours after birth**. Vernix caseosa, an insulator and bacteriostatic protective biofilm. It should not be washed away, as it will shed off within 24 hours. Alkaline soap is not used to wash as it rids good bacteria from the body.
## Properly-Timed Cord Clamping
*Late* cord clamping is done 1 to 3 minutes after birth, or **once placental pulsation has stopped**. It is recommended as it provides additional bloodâ€” 50 to 100 mL containing iron, antibodies (IgG), hormones (thyroxine, estrogen, progesterone, etc.), and enzymes for the newborn and improves oxygenation as the newborn adjusts to extrauterine life.
- **Procedure**: apply the **cord clamp 2 cm** from the base, and the **forceps 5 cm** from the base. The cord may be cut **1 cm from the cord clamp; 3 cm from the base**. **Do not milk the cord**.
- Cutting of the cord results in decreased pressure in the right side of the heart, which results in the closure of the ductus venosus (1, umbilical vein to inferior vena cava) and umbilical blood vessels (2). This promotes adequate circulation and, along with lung expansion, completes the circulatory changes after birth.
- The cord should be air-dried, to prevent infection. The umbilical cord will fall off within 7 to 10 days. Betadine is not used.
## Non-separation of Newborn from Mother for Early Breastfeeding
Within 60 or 90 minutes, breastfeeding prevents an estimated 19.1% of all neonatal deaths. It promotes **bonding**, stimulates the mother to **release colostrum and breastmilk**, and of the hormones **prolactin** (for milk production) from the APG and **oxytocin** (happy hormone and Let Down Reflex) from the PPG. This in turn **stimulates uterine contraction**, which prevents bleeding.
- It promotes **uterine involution** (physiologic return to pre-pregnant state)
- Breastfeeding allows the child to pass meconium earlier and more frequently (*gastrocolic reflex*), which promotes the excretion of bilirubin. (It's why meconium is so yellow)
- Taurine in breastmilk **promotes infant brain and intellect development**.
- Breastmilk **boosts the immune system**, containing WBCs, macrophages, IgA, and Lactoferrin.
- Advise the mother to eat **galactagogues** and drink plenty of water. These are foods that promote milk production, such as oats, garlic, almonds, coconut, leafy vegetables, sago, yams, beets, carrots, green papaya, shellfish, grains, nuts, sesame seeds, and many more. Advise her to **avoid peanuts, alcohol, tea/coffee, spicy foods, peppermint, high-mercury fish, and gas-inducing foods**.
- Exclusive, frequent day and night breastfeeding may be used as contraception, through the **Lactational Amenorrhea Method** (LAM). This method is currently known to be effective for **the first six months** after giving birth, as it inhibits the release of FSH.
- **Colostrum** is the first breast milk released. It contains more antibodies and protein (lactoglobulin) than in normal breastmilk (lactalbumin). However, there are more carbohydrates in breastmilk (lactose). Both contain about the same amount of fats. Both are **poor sources of iron**.
- Related: **R.A. 7600**, the **Rooming-In and Breast-feeding Act** of 1992, and **E.O. 51**, the **Milk Code**.
>[!WARNING] The DO NOTs 
>Do not ventilate unless the baby is floppy/limp and not breathing.
>Do not suction unless the mouth/nose are blocked with secretions or other material.
>Do not suction meconium unless the baby is not vigorous
>Do not "*milk*" the umbilical cord towards the newborn. This may cause circulatory overload, and contribute to jaundice.
>Do not separate the newborn from the mother unless indicated (newborn does not have severe chest in-drawing, gasping, apnea; mother does not need urgent medical stabilization)
>Do not place the newborn on a cold or wet surface.
>Do not wipe off vernix if present.
>Do not bathe the newborn earlier than 6 hours of life.
>Do not do *footprinting* (old identification method), as it introduces a risk for contamination.
## Other Priorities
1. **Identification**: utilize double-banding (using two identifiers), ideally in the presence of the parents.
2. **Crede's Prophylaxis**: 1% silver nitrate (drops) or ophthalmic ointment (terramycin, gentamycin, erythromycin, penicillin) placed to protect from ophthalmia neonatorum (neonatal conjunctivitis) resulting from maternal STDs.
3. **Vitamin K Injection**: for promotion of coagulation; prevent bleeding. The lack of normal gut flora in the newborn results in insufficient vitamin K synthesis, resulting in physiologic hypoprothrombinemia.
	- Dosage: 1 mg for term/postterm newborns (0.1 mL) and 0.5 mg for preterm newborns (0.05 mL).
	- Route and Site: IM, Vastus Lateralis or Rectus Femoris
4. **Anthropometric Measurement**: the measurement of various bodily dimensions of the child to identify potential abnormalities.
	- Weight is measured with an infant weighing scale.
	- Length is measured from crown (posterior fontanel) to heel, following the contours of the body.
	- Head circumference is measured one fingerbreadth above the eyebrows.
	- Chest circumference is measured at nipple level.
	- Abdominal circumference is measured at the umbilical level.

| Measurement             | Normal         | (SI)                 |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | -------------------- |
| Birth Weight            | 5.5 to 7.8 lbs | 2,500 to 3,400 grams |
| Birth Length            | 18 to 22 in    | 48 to 54 cm          |
| Head Circumference      | 13 to 14 in    | 33 to 35 cm          |
| Chest Circumference     | 12 to 13 in    | 31 to 33 cm          |
| Abdominal Circumference | 11 to 12 in    | 29 to 31 cm          |
>[!WARNING] Variance
>Values change between references; in second year discussion, abdominal circumference was also 31 to 33 cm, birth length was 47 to 54 cm, and body weight was 2,500 to 4,000 grams.

5. **Immunization**: refer to [[Expanded Program on Immunization]].
6. **Newborn Screening Test**:

# Fun Facts
(*things the lecturer mentions, but is questionably within the scope of the presentation*)
1. Neonates primarily breathe through their nose, as adults do. This is why suctioning is done on the mouth first, before the nose.
2. Failure of the neonate to breathe within 60 seconds
3. Bilirubin is *not* produced by the liver; the liver produces glucuronyl transferase that converts indirect bilirubin to direct bilirubin. In newborns, this enzyme is not sufficient, which results in physiologic jaundice.
4. The four signs of infection are rubor, tumor, calor, and dolor; respectively, redness, swelling, heat, and pain.
5. Colostrum may begin begin produced as early as 5 months of pregnancy.
6. Milk expressed during breastfeeding may be divided into two categories: foremilk and hindmilk. Foremilk contains more water and nutrients, while hindmilk contains more fat and calories. This is why it is important to perform complete breastfeeding.
