This is only an excerpt of **Ma'am Aurisita Maganis Delos Reyes**'s presentation, revised into a web format/noted down using the outline method. A good exercise to do for review is to re-summarize this information as it was in the presentation, pointing out and organizing key points and information.

I'll supplement information when relevant, but this is **probably not reflective of the comprehensive information provided during her live discussions**. You can find the presentation and the recorded discussions in [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1AEz4QnhFf5cAOq_Twn8UxNavvzm__QiK).

# Essential Intrapartum and Newborn Care
"Essential Newborn Care" (ENC) is a part of Essential Intrapartum Newborn Care (EINC). It is a simple, cost-effective newborn care intervention that can improve both neonatal and maternal care. It is also known as *Unang Yakap* (First Embrace) and consists of four core steps: immediate and thorough drying, early skin-to-skin contact, properly-timed cord clamping, and non-separation of newborn from mother for early breastfeeding. Following this immediate care, six supplemental priorities take place: identification, Crede's prophylaxis, vitamin K injection, immunization, newborn screening, and anthropometric measurement.
## Immediate and Thorough Drying
Within the first 30 seconds, dry and rub the newborn, or until the newborn responds by crying. Drying acts to **prevent hypothermia** as the thermoregulatory capacity of the newborn is not yet stable.
- This action **stimulates lung expansion** and allows the nurse to **assess the breathing** of the newborn. Lung expansion increases pressure in the left side of the heart, which results in the closure of the fetal structures (foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus).
- **Suction the airways** (mouth before nose, to account for reflex breathing, for 5 to 10 seconds) **only if necessary**. Routine suctioning is *not recommended*.
- Afterwards, **position the newborn prone on the mother**. This can lead to an initiation of the **crawling reflex**, a sign of readiness for feeding.
## Early Skin-to-skin Contact
From 1 minute to 30 or 60 minutes, and with the newborn on the mother, place a bonnet over the head (a major portion of heat loss comes from the head) and a blanket for the back. Benefits of skin-to-skin contact include the **transfer of heat, normal skin flora, and love from the mother to the newborn**.
- The period where baths are recommended is **at least 6 to 8 hours after birth**. Vernix caseosa, an insulator and bacteriostatic protective biofilm. It should not be washed away, as it will shed off within 24 hours. Alkaline soap is not used to wash as it rids good bacteria from the body.
## Properly-Timed Cord Clamping
*Late* cord clamping is done 1 to 3 minutes after birth, or **once placental pulsation has stopped**. It is recommended as it provides additional blood— 50 to 100 mL containing iron, antibodies (IgG), hormones (thyroxine, estrogen, progesterone, etc.), and enzymes for the newborn and improves oxygenation as the newborn adjusts to extrauterine life.
- **Procedure**: apply the **cord clamp 2 cm** from the base, and the **forceps 5 cm** from the base. The cord may be cut **1 cm from the cord clamp; 3 cm from the base**. **Do not milk the cord**.
- Cutting of the cord results in decreased pressure in the right side of the heart, which results in the closure of the ductus venosus (1, umbilical vein to inferior vena cava) and umbilical blood vessels (2). This promotes adequate circulation and, along with lung expansion, completes the circulatory changes after birth.
- The cord should be air-dried, to prevent infection. The umbilical cord will fall off within 7 to 10 days. Betadine is not used.
## Non-separation of Newborn from Mother for Early Breastfeeding
Within 60 or 90 minutes, breastfeeding prevents an estimated 19.1% of all neonatal deaths. It promotes **bonding**, stimulates the mother to **release colostrum and breastmilk**, and of the hormones **prolactin** (for milk production) from the APG and **oxytocin** (happy hormone and Let Down Reflex) from the PPG. This in turn **stimulates uterine contraction**, which prevents bleeding.
- It promotes **uterine involution** (physiologic return to pre-pregnant state)
- Breastfeeding allows the child to pass meconium earlier and more frequently (*gastrocolic reflex*), which promotes the excretion of bilirubin. (It's why meconium is so yellow)
- Taurine in breastmilk **promotes infant brain and intellect development**.
- Breastmilk **boosts the immune system**, containing WBCs, macrophages, IgA, and Lactoferrin.
- Advise the mother to eat **galactagogues** and drink plenty of water. These are foods that promote milk production, such as oats, garlic, almonds, coconut, leafy vegetables, sago, yams, beets, carrots, green papaya, shellfish, grains, nuts, sesame seeds, and many more. Advise her to **avoid peanuts, alcohol, tea/coffee, spicy foods, peppermint, high-mercury fish, and gas-inducing foods**.
- Exclusive, frequent day and night breastfeeding may be used as contraception, through the **Lactational Amenorrhea Method** (LAM). This method is currently known to be effective for **the first six months** after giving birth, as it inhibits the release of FSH.
- **Colostrum** is the first breast milk released. It contains more antibodies and protein (lactoglobulin) than in normal breastmilk (lactalbumin). However, there are more carbohydrates in breastmilk (lactose). Both contain about the same amount of fats. Both are **poor sources of iron**.
- Related: **R.A. 7600**, the **Rooming-In and Breast-feeding Act** of 1992, and **E.O. 51**, the **Milk Code**.
>[!WARNING] The DO NOTs 
>Do not ventilate unless the baby is floppy/limp and not breathing.
>Do not suction unless the mouth/nose are blocked with secretions or other material.
>Do not suction meconium unless the baby is not vigorous
>Do not "*milk*" the umbilical cord towards the newborn. This may cause circulatory overload, and contribute to jaundice.
>Do not separate the newborn from the mother unless indicated (newborn does not have severe chest in-drawing, gasping, apnea; mother does not need urgent medical stabilization)
>Do not place the newborn on a cold or wet surface.
>Do not wipe off vernix if present.
>Do not bathe the newborn earlier than 6 hours of life.
>Do not do *footprinting* (old identification method), as it introduces a risk for contamination.
## Other Priorities
1. **Identification**: utilize double-banding (using two identifiers), ideally in the presence of the parents.
2. **Crede's Prophylaxis**: 1% silver nitrate (drops) or ophthalmic ointment (terramycin, gentamycin, erythromycin, penicillin) placed to protect from ophthalmia neonatorum (neonatal conjunctivitis) resulting from maternal STDs.
3. **Vitamin K Injection**: for promotion of coagulation; prevent bleeding. The lack of normal gut flora in the newborn results in insufficient vitamin K synthesis, resulting in physiologic hypoprothrombinemia.
	- Dosage: 1 mg for term/postterm newborns (0.1 mL) and 0.5 mg for preterm newborns (0.05 mL).
	- Route and Site: IM, Vastus Lateralis or Rectus Femoris
4. **Anthropometric Measurement**: the measurement of various bodily dimensions of the child to identify potential abnormalities.
	- Weight is measured with an infant weighing scale.
	- Length is measured from crown (posterior fontanel) to heel, following the contours of the body.
	- Head circumference is measured one fingerbreadth above the eyebrows.
	- Chest circumference is measured at nipple level.
	- Abdominal circumference is measured at the umbilical level.

| Measurement             | Normal         | (SI)                 |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | -------------------- |
| Birth Weight            | 5.5 to 7.8 lbs | 2,500 to 3,400 grams |
| Birth Length            | 18 to 22 in    | 48 to 54 cm          |
| Head Circumference      | 13 to 14 in    | 33 to 35 cm          |
| Chest Circumference     | 12 to 13 in    | 31 to 33 cm          |
| Abdominal Circumference | 11 to 12 in    | 29 to 31 cm          |
>[!WARNING] Variance
>Values change between references; in second year discussion, abdominal circumference was also 31 to 33 cm, birth length was 47 to 54 cm, and body weight was 2,500 to 4,000 grams.

5. **Immunization**: refer to [[Expanded Program on Immunization]].
6. **Newborn Screening Test**: based on **R.A. 9288**, the Newborn Screening Act of 2004. It is done within 48 to 72 hours. The diseases screened within this act is checked to prevent mental retardation, physical abnormalities, and death.
	- A Heelstick method is used to collect 4 drops of blood. The blood is analyzed within two to three weeks.
	- Six diseases are screened for: **Phenylketonuria**, **Galactosemia**, **G6PDD**, **Cretinism**, **Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia** (CAH), **Maple Syrup Urine Disease** (MSUD)
	- **Hearing** is also screened. Sounds are played into the ears, and its response is measured. It can be done within 10 minutes and results are immediate.

# Assessment Tools for a Newborn
## APGAR Scoring
>[!CITE] Wong's Nursing Care of Infants and Children, pp. 199-200

Created by **Dr. Virginia Apgar**, this is a screening test done one minute and five minutes after birth. The first test is to determine the newborn's ability to cope with the birthing process, and the second test is done to determine the newborn's ability to adjust to extrauterine life. This test determines the **degree of acidosis** and aids in determining **the need for CPR**.

| Criteria    | Score of 2                   | Score of 1                          | Score of 0                 |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Appearance  | Pink                         | Acrocyanosis (extremities are blue) | Central cyanosis or pallor |
| Pulse       | >100 BPM                     | <100 BPM                            | No pulse                   |
| Grimace     | Cries, sneezes, pulls away   | Grimaces or weak cry                | No response                |
| Activity    | Active movement; well flexed | Some flexion of extremities         | Flaccid/limp; no movement  |
| Respiration | Good, strong cry             | Weak cry; slow/irregular            | No breathing               |
The score is tallied, and interpreted as:
1. **0 to 3**: poor, serious, severely depressed. CPR may be required.
2. **4 to 6**: fair, guarded, moderately depressed. Suctioning may be required. Monitoring is required.
3. **7 to 10**: good, healthy.
## Silverman-Anderson Index
Also known as Silverman-Anderson Respiratory Severity Score (RSS). It evaluates five parameters of work of breathing and assigns an overall score with a patient breathing comfortably a `0` and a patient in severe respiratory distress a `10`.

| Scoring | Upper Chest          | Lower Chest   | Xiphoid Retract | Nares Dilate | Expiratory Grunt            |
| ------- | -------------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ------------ | --------------------------- |
| 0       | Synchronized         | No retraction | None            | None         | None                        |
| 1       | Lag on respirations  | Just visible  | Just visible    | Minimal      | Audible on Stethoscope Only |
| 2       | See-saw Respirations | Marked        | Marked          | Marked       | Audible by Naked ear        |
The score is tallied, and interpreted as:
1. **0 to 3**: good, healthy, no respiratory distress.
2. **4 to 6**: fair, guarded, mild respiratory distress.
3. **7 to 10**: poor, serious, severely respiratory distress.

## Ballard Scoring
>[!CITE] Wong's Nursing Care of Infants and Children, pp. 202-203

Evaluates gestational maturity based on neuromuscular maturity and physical maturity.

Neuromuscular maturity is determined by observing:
1. **Posture**: with infant quiet and in a supine position, observe degree of flexion in arms and legs. Muscle tone and degree of flexion increases with maturity. Score: Full flexion of arms and legs = 4.
2. **Square Window** (Wrist): with thumb supporting back of arm below wrist, apply gently pressure with index and third fingers on dorsum of hand without rotating infant's wrist. Measure angle between base of thumb and forearm. Score: Full flexion (hand lies flat on ventral surface of forearm) = 4 
3. **Arm Recoil**: with infant supine, fully flex both forearms on upper arms, hold for 5s; pull down on hands to fully extend and rapidly release arms. Observe rapidity and intensity of recoil to a state of flexion. Score: A brisk return to full flexion = 4.
4. **Popliteal Angle**: with infant supine and pelvis flat on a firm surface, flex lower leg on thigh and then flex thigh on abdomen. While holding knee with thumb and index finger, extend lower leg with index finger of other hand. Measure degree of angle behind knee (popliteal angle). Score: an angle of less than 90° = 5
5. **Scarf Sign**: with infant supine, support head in midline with one hand; use other hand to pull infant's arm across the shoulder so that infant's hand touches shoulder. Determine location of elbow in relation to midline. Score: elbow does not reach midline = 4.
6. **Heel-to-Ear**: with infant supine and pelvis flat on a firm surface, pull foot as far as possible up toward ear on same side. Measure distance of foot from ear and degree of knee flexion (same as popliteal angle). Score: knees flexed with a popliteal angle of less than 10° = 4.

Physical maturity is determined characteristically based on neonatal skin, presence of lanugo, the plantar surface, breasts, eye and ears, and genitals. Expected appearance for pre-term, term, and post-term are:

|                   | Preterm                                            | Term                                                   | Postterm                                                                |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Skin              | Gelatinous, transparent; visible blood vessels     | Smooth, pink, superficial cracking, less visible veins | Parchment-like, deep cracking, no visible blood vessels                 |
| Ear Cartilage     | Absent/Pliable                                     | Formed and firm with instant recoil                    | Thick cartilage; stiff                                                  |
| Breast Nodule     | 1-2 mm                                             | 3-5 mm                                                 | 6-10 mm                                                                 |
| Genitals (Male)   | Undescended; less swollen testes. Few rugae.       | More swollen; more rugae                               | Fully descended; pendulous (swings). Markedly swollen. Extensive rugae. |
| Genitals (Female) | Clitoris and minora prominent                      | Majora partially covers                                | Majora completely covers minora and clitoris.                           |
| Sole Creases      | Only anterior and transverse surfaces have creases | 2/3 of the sole has creases                            | The entire sole has creases.                                            |
| Lanugo            | Abundant                                           | Less Lanugo                                            | No Lanugo.                                                              |

The actual form with visualizations can be found [here](https://renaissance.stonybrookmedicine.edu/sites/default/files/Ballard%20Score.pdf). The form is based on the New Ballard Score by J.L. Ballard et al. in 1991.
![[ballard_scoring.png]]
Note the interpretation for **Maturity Rating**: a score of less than 35 is preterm (36 weeks and below), 35 to 45 is term, and above 45 is post-term.
## Vital Signs
1. **Respiratory Rate**: normally 80 breaths/min soon after birth, stabilizing to 30-60 breaths/min. The breathing of a newborn is normally rapid, irregular, with normal physiologic apnea of <15 seconds in a minute. They are shallow but quiet, and abdominal/diaphragmatic.
2. **Pulse Rate**: normally 180 BPM, stabilizing to 120-160 BPM. It is also rapid and irregular, increasing with crying and decreasing during sleep. The sites for pulse rate observation in a newborn may be at the apical pulse, brachial pulse, femoral pulse, (if weak, this suggests CoA), and pedal pulse.
3. **Temperature**: the thermoregulating center of a newborn is immature. Reasons for difficulty in maintaining temperature include an underdeveloped shivering mechanism, inadequate adipose tissues, and large surface area, making newborns more prone to heat loss. The normal temperature of a newborn is 36.4°C to 37.2°C (*Prof. says 36.5°C to 37.5°C*). It takes 6 to 8 hours after birth for temperature to stabilize.
	- **Complications of hypothermia**:
		1. **Hypoglycemia**: normally 30 to 65 MG%
		2. **Metabolic acidosis**
		3. **Respiratory Distress**
4. **Blood Pressure**: normally 80/46 mm Hg at birth, increasing to 100/50 in 10 days. When measured, it is normally higher in the lower extremities than in the upper extremities. Otherwise, this also suggests a congenital heart defect (CoA). Measurement may be via doppler or flush methods.
	- Blood pressure monitoring is optional in a newborn, but is required at 3 years old.
## Physical Assessment
The usual **cephalocaudal direction** in assessment is started in **preschoolers** (4 to 6 years old). For younger children, the **chest** is the first target.
### Chest Assessment
1. **Retractions**: visual inspection for retractions that may indicate respiratory distress.
2. **Breath Sounds**: auscultate the lungs for breath sounds.
	- If **absent**, the lungs are not expanding; collapsed lungs or atelectasis.
	- **Wheezes**, especially upon expiration, may indicate a lower respiratory tract obstruction.
	- **Stridor**, high-pitched adventitious sounds upon inspiration indicates an upper respiratory tract obstruction.
	- **Rales or crackles** are rattling, bubbling, or clicking sounds. This is commonly found in fluid or secretory obstruction in the lungs.
3. **Witch Milk**: colorless or transparent fluid expressed by the neonatal mammary glands caused by maternal hormones.
### Head Assessment
1. **Fontanels**: there are six in total; the anterior fontanel, the posterior fontanel, two sphenoid (anterolateral) fontanel, and two mastoid (posterolateral) fontanel.
	- The anterior fontanel is diamond-shaped and 3-4 cm long and 2-3 cm wide. If the fontanel is larger than 5 cm, it may indicate hydrocephaly or cretinism. It closes within 12 to 18 months, as early as 9 months. Earlier closure is termed "*Craniostenosis*".
	- The posterior fontanel is triangle-shaped and measures 2 cm long and 1 cm wide. It closes within 2 to 3 months. It is pulsatile and flat. Bulging may indicate increased ICP, but bulging while crying is normal. If the fontanel is depressed/sunken, it may indicate dehydration.
#### Complications
1. **Craniosynostosis**/**Craniostenosis**: premature closure of the fontanels and sutures. It can limit brain growth and available volume in the skull. This can increase ICP, mental retardation, brain herniation (through the foramen magnum), and death.
2. **Caput Succedaneum**: swelling of the scalp caused by a prolonged second stage of labor. This swelling affects both sides, crossing the suture line. There is no special treatment required, as it normally resolves within two to three days.
3. **Cephalhematoma**: collection or accumulation of blood caused by a rupture of periosteal capillaries. It does *not* cross the suture line, only affecting one hemisphere. It disappears in three to four weeks. The bleeding can contribute to jaundice.
4. **Craniotabes**: localized softening of the cranial bones. It is commonly seen in early lightening and firstborn babies. It disappears in six weeks.
5. **Molding**: overlapping cranial bones after birth as the bones squeeze together to pass through the birth canal. This is common among preterm babies.
### Face Assessment
1. **Symmetry**: the face should be symmetrical. If the face is markedly **asymmetrical**, it can indicate **facial nerve (CN VII) paralysis** i.e. **Bell's Palsy**.
2. **Eyes**: the pupils are equal, round, reactive to light, and accommodation (PERRLA). The lacrimal duct is immature, so no tears form.
#### Complications
1. **Bell's Palsy**: paralysis of the facial nerve (CN VII). Management aims to prevent the premature disappearance of the sucking reflex. For this, the baby is fed with dropped and syringe, and encouraged to breastfeed. Aspiration precautions are applied.
2. **Coloboma**: a keyhole appearance of the eyes from a hole formed in one of the structures of the eyes.
3. **Exotropia Strabismus**: wall-eyed defect of the eyes, and **Esotropia Strabismus**: cross-eyed defect of the eyes. Non-physiologic strabismus is managed with occlusion therapy, surgery (SQUINT), corrective glasses, and laser therapy.

# Fun Facts
(*things the lecturer mentions, but is questionably within the scope of the presentation*)
1. Neonates primarily breathe through their nose, as adults do. This is why suctioning is done on the mouth first, before the nose.
2. Failure of the neonate to breathe within 60 seconds
3. Bilirubin is *not* produced by the liver; the liver produces glucuronyl transferase that converts indirect bilirubin to direct bilirubin. In newborns, this enzyme is not sufficient, which results in physiologic jaundice.
4. The four signs of infection are rubor, tumor, calor, and dolor; respectively, redness, swelling, heat, and pain.
5. Colostrum may begin begin produced as early as 5 months of pregnancy.
6. Milk expressed during breastfeeding may be divided into two categories: foremilk and hindmilk. Foremilk contains more water and nutrients, while hindmilk contains more fat and calories. This is why it is important to perform complete breastfeeding.
