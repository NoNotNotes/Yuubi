Naturally, because I am not practicing law, much of the information written is summarized and many aspects of the laws and legal jargon is omitted, trusting their essence would come as "*common sense*" to me or anyone reading them. I still suggest [purchasing the book](https://cebookshop.com/product/8049145) yourself and giving it a read. Enjoy one of the most intriguing (or most boring) aspects of nursing education you will have to face for the board exam.
