# Nursing Research
According to **Kerlinger**, **research** is the systematic, empirical, controlled and critical investigation of a hypothetical proposition in relation to a natural phenomena or problem conducted to **affirm or deny a hypothesis**.
- **Phenomenon**: everyday phenomenon that affects the nurse, e.g., bacteria, drugs, physician. This, in combination with a hypothesis about it, can form a **research problem**.
- **Hypothesis**: an educated, scientific guess as a tentative answer for the problem. The presence of a hypothesis elevates a *problem* into a *research problem*.

Major Characteristics of a Good or Major Research
1. **Systematic**: research is done in a **step-by-step process or procedure**.
2. **Empirical**: **objective data** should be **observable/measurable or readily collected using your senses**.
3. **Controlled**/**Manipulated**: methods and tools are used to controlling elements of the research as part of the research design.
4. **Critical Investigation**/**Fact Finding Investigation**: facts are used as data. A crucial aspect of data gathering is to find individuals who can reliably provide the facts that researchers require.

Purpose of Research in Nursing Profession (*mn. DEED*)
1. **Descriptive**: observe, describe and record phenomenon to gain richer familiarity regarding the phenomena. This requires the phenomenon to be **100% known** to the nurses conducting research.
2. **Exploratory**: **explore to those areas that are unknown**. This is used if a nurse does not completely understand a phenomenon.
3. **Experimental**: an active intervention or manipulation to determine a **cause-and-effect relationship**; a controlled change is created before observing results to determine changes attributable to said change.
4. **Developmental**: to **improve the system of care** for the your patient. Conducting research is for the benefit of the patient, their care, or patient focus.
## Ethics of a Researcher
**mn. SCIENTIFIC**
1. **Scientific Objective**: the research is done for a good purpose or object with your patient.
2. **Cooperation and Consent**: obtain all necessary consent and cooperation of all patients involved in the research.
3. **Integrity**: the adherence to ethical principles and conscience of a researcher.
4. **Equitable**: acknowledging the works or contributions of others.
5. **Nobility**: the protection of rights of the subject.
>[!INFO] Patient Rights
>- **Right not to be Harmed**: safety from physical, mental, or moral harm.
>>[!FAIL] Harmful Acts to Patients
>>1. **Physical Harm**, often from **negligence**. This may be done through commission (actual performance of harmful act) or through omission (failure to perform a preventive act).
>>2. **Moral Harm**:
>>	- **Assault**: induction of threat
>>	- **Battery**: physical harm to the patient. A common case for battery is the unnecessary application of **restraint**, either physically or chemically (with psychotropics, etc.)
>>	- **Slander**: oral defamation
>>	- **Libel**: written defamation
>
>- **Right to Self-determination**: the principle that an individual has the right to decide on all relevant healthcare symptoms.
>- **Right to Privacy**: **anonymity** (protect identity) and **confidentiality** (protect the information obtained).

6. **Truthfulness**: the use of data only verifiable to and obtained by the researcher.
7. **Important**: the research done is of positive effect to the nursing profession.
8. **Factual**: the use of facts; empirical, reliable data.
9. **Ideal**: follow the eleven steps of research.
10. **Courageous**
## Steps of the Nursing Research Process
1. **Identification/Formulation of a Research Problem**: anything that may be solved through a scientific investigation.
	- **Sources of a Research Problem** (mn. CLIENT):
		- **Concepts** (Cancer, Pulmonary Tuberculosis, Myocardial Infarction, etc.)
		- **Literature** (essays, books, journals)
		- **Issues**
		- **Experience**
		- **Nursing Problems**
		- **Theories**
	 - **Characteristics of a Research Problem** (mn. GREFINS)
		 - **General** applicability and use
		 - **Researchable**
		 - **Feasible** and measurable: in time, money, experience (of the researcher), instruments, and population.
		 - **Important** to the nursing profession
		 - **Novel** and original, especially important against **plagiarism**.
		 - **Significant** to the nursing profession
	- **Types of Research Problems**:
		- **Basic/Pure Research**: research done to research; done for personal necessity or to answer one's question and no more.
		- **Applied Research**: research done to resolve an issue; to solve a problem.

>[!INFO] Variables
>Variables are the **elements of a research problem** subject to change and observation. Depending on their nature or place in the research,  they may be defined as:
>1. **Independent Variable**: 
>2. **Dependent Variable/Effectual Variable**: 
>3. **Intervening Variable**: 
>4. **Extraneous Variable**: 
>5. **Dichotomous Variable**: 
>6. **Polychotomous Variable**:
