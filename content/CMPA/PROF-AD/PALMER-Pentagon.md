# Nursing Research
According to **Kerlinger**, **research** is the systematic, empirical, controlled and critical investigation of a hypothetical proposition in relation to a natural phenomena or problem conducted to **affirm or deny a hypothesis**.
- **Phenomenon**: everyday phenomenon that affects the nurse, e.g., bacteria, drugs, physician. This, in combination with a hypothesis about it, can form a **research problem**.
- **Hypothesis**: an educated, scientific guess as a tentative answer for the problem. The presence of a hypothesis elevates a *problem* into a *research problem*.

Major Characteristics of a Good or Major Research
1. **Systematic**: research is done in a **step-by-step process or procedure**.
2. **Empirical**: **objective data** should be **observable/measurable or readily collected using your senses**.
3. **Controlled**/**Manipulated**: methods and tools are used to controlling elements of the research as part of the research design.
4. **Critical Investigation**/**Fact Finding Investigation**: facts are used as data. A crucial aspect of data gathering is to find individuals who can reliably provide the facts that researchers require.

Purpose of Research in Nursing Profession (*mn. DEED*)
1. **Descriptive**: observe, describe and record phenomenon to gain richer familiarity regarding the phenomena. This requires the phenomenon to be **100% known** to the nurses conducting research.
2. **Exploratory**: **explore to those areas that are unknown**. This is used if a nurse does not completely understand a phenomenon.
3. **Experimental**: an active intervention or manipulation to determine a **cause-and-effect relationship**; a controlled change is created before observing results to determine changes attributable to said change.
4. **Developmental**: to **improve the system of care** for the your patient. Conducting research is for the benefit of the patient, their care, or patient focus.
