# V: Population Health Nursing
Varying population groups require special attention, care, and sensitivity to ensure that their needs are met. Health care disparities exist between different groups of people. Some of the vulnerable groups that are at risk for health disparities include minority groups, uninsured groups, the impoverished or homeless, refugees, immigrants, disabled people, those with chronic health problems, those who are incarcerated, those with limited English proficiency, and members of the LGBTQIA community. They experience greater risk factors, a lack of necessary access to care, and increased morbidity and mortality as compared with the general population.
- Nurses should be aware of the disparities that exist and plan to prevent them.
- Nurses should be self-aware and understand their own culture, values, beliefs, ethics, personality, and communication style. Recognizing all biases and being respectful to all people despite differences can influence satisfaction and quality of care.
- Nurses should know of the most prevalent diseases and infections for population groups.
- Initial health care visits and every visit thereafter need to be done with a nonjudgmental, nonthreatening approach. Populations have general similarities, but each patient is an individual, and stereotyping should be avoided.5
- Focus on the clients' reported symptoms first. This encourages adherence and follow-up. Subsequent care should include health maintenance, attention to common problems and concerns, and establishing an emergency contact person, if available.
## Chronic Health Problems and Common Infectious Diseases in the U.S.

## COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic is a serious global health pandemic and is a major public health concern. It has caused severe illness and even death in some individuals. COVID-19 may be more easily contracted by the elderly; those with a chronic health condition e.g. diabetes or respiratory or cardiac disease; those who have cancer; those who are immunocompromised e.g. from chemotherapy or disease; and minority groups. (John Hopkins [COVID-19 racial disparities](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/covid19-racial-disparities)). Other populations affected are those living in crowded conditions or are institutionalized. It is considered a respiratory illness that is caused by a virus called SARS-CoV, although the illness is respiratory in nature, the virus also attacks and affects many different body systems.
- **Symptoms**: cough, shortness of breath, respiratory congestion, fever, muscle pain, sore throat, loss of taste and/or smell; additionally body aches, fatigue, runny nose, and gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Other manifestations may occur.
- **Danger Signs** that indicate immediate need for emergency care: difficulty breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, new confusion, inability to wake or stay awake, bluish lips or face (cyanosis)
- When admitted with the suspicion of COVID-19, controlling the spread of the disease is a primary concern. The nurse institutes safety measures for protecting and preventing that client from contracting the illness. Be an advocate for educating the public about the measures to prevent its spread. These include hand washing, eye protection, the use of a mask, physical distancing, avoiding crowded situations, avoiding close contact with people whoa re sick, covering the nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing, keeping the hands away from the eyes and face, and self-quarantine.
## Minority Groups
Some individuals in these groups may be less likely to have health insurance coverage or a regular source of health care.
([Center for American Progress: Health disparities by race and ethnicity](https://cdn.americanprogress.org/content/uploads/2020/05/06130714/HealthRace-factsheet.pdf?_ga=2.26243709.1539460156.1624832457--65922829.1624832457)).
- Obesity, diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease secondary to diabetes, and cervical cancer are more common among the Hispanic American/Latinx population.
- The Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders population is noted to have higher rates of smoking, alcohol consumption, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. Hepatitis B, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and tuberculosis are more frequent diseases. Noted is that there is a high incidence of infant mortality and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in this population.
- In the Native American and Alaska Native populations, geographic isolation and income may be factors with regard to receiving health care. Inadequate water supply and sewage disposal can be a factor with infectious diseases. Smoking and the use of alcohol are more common, and diabetes mellitus, cancer, stroke, heart disease, and accidents are a concern. Additional concerns include mental health alterations, suicide, infant mortality, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), teenage pregnancy, liver disease, and hepatitis.
- Obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, heart disease, asthma, and cancer occur more commonly among African Americans, with leading causes of death being heart disease, cancer, and stroke.
- Cancer, tuberculosis, and hepatitis are more common health problems of Asian Americans, with leading causes of death being cancer, heart disease, and stroke.

Health care considerations:
1. **Cultural responsiveness** is critical to reduce disparity. This can help improve health outcomes and quality of care.
2. The nurse and other health care professionals need to be aware of **health care variations and risk factors for various populations** in order to facilitate appropriate care and access to needed health care services.
3. It is important for the nurse to **examine their own values** to be responsive to the needs of someone from another population group; awareness is a useful tool in caring for others.
4. **Language barriers** influence access to health care. It is important to remember than **family and friends should not be asked to be interpreters** for confidentiality, potential conflicts of interest, and risk of miscommunication. Designated interpreters by the institution should be called upon.
5. **Lack of access** to preventive care needs to be addressed.
6. Important health education topics include **preventive lifestyle practices**: **diet**, **meal planning**, **exercise**, and other lifestyle changes that reduce the risk for diseases, including infectious and communicable diseases.
7. Return explanation and return demonstration are of particular important to ensure safety and mutual understanding.
## Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex, Asexual Individuals
This group represents a wide range of varying characteristics. They are collectively referred to as "LGBTQIA". Among healthcare professionals, there is often a lack of awareness about the specific needs of this population.
- **Fears of stigmatization and being viewed as different** can reduce willingness to approach health care providers.
- Transgender individuals may be less likely than other groups to have certain screenings done, e.g., a prostate exam for a transgender woman, or a mammogram for a transgender man. ([GLAAD Media Reference Guide: Transgender](https://www.glaad.org/reference/transgender))
- **Sexually transmitted diseases** are of concern for this population.
- **Breast cancer and cervical cancer** are a concern, likely because of reduced screenings and nulliparity.
- **Depression and suicide** are concerns.
- **Rejection from friends, family members, and social support systems** may be a stressor. Teenage members of this population are more likely to be threatened, bullied, injured, raped, and victimized. For these reasons, **school absenteeism** can be a problem. Youth in this population is at **heightened risk for abuse by family members** due to their sexual orientation.
- This population may also experience struggle with child-rearing due to the expenses of adoption, artificial insemination, and surrogacy. They may also fail to quality for certain benefits, e.g. spousal death benefits, and are less likely to have family members who assist them in elderly or disability care.

Health care considerations:
1. Create a welcoming, nonjudgmental environment when caring for this population. Using their **preferred pronouns** allow for developing and maintaining rapport. Measures such as altering signage in gender identification in forms can better serve the health needs of this population. Treat the patient **according to their identity** while also maintaining an understanding of their risk factors based on biological drivers of health.
2. Health promotion measures focuses on **screening** for health concerns such as cancer, STIs, depression, and suicide; and **health education** particularly for safe sex practices.
3. A **careful sexual history** and **appropriate counselling** is important for all members of this population.
4. Nonocuppational postexposure prophylaxis (nPEP) or prophylactic antiretrovirals should be considered for those with potential for HIV.
5. **Hormone therapy needs to be monitored** at regular intervals; associated complications, such as polycythemia occurring with exogenous testosterone use, need to be detected and treated early.
6. **Biological and reassigned gender-based preventive screenings** should still be continued for those who have underwent sexual reassignment; e.g. transgender men over the age of 50 should continue to have regular breast cancer screening by way of mammography, with the new presence of breast tissue. However transgender women should also undergo screening due to the risk of residual breast tissue forming cancer.
## Homeless Individuals
All backgrounds and family units can be affected by homelessness. There is a risk for early death related to health problems. Disability often results from illness and becomes a barrier to employment, which further augments the problem of homelessness.
- Infants affected by homelessness often have low birth weights and are more likely to die during infancy (12 months).
- Children affected by homelessness are sick more often with illnesses such as asthma, iron deficiency, lead poisoning, ear infections, gastrointestinal illness, and behavioral and mental health problems. They may begin to act out or become less attentive in the classroom when needs are not met. Risk-taking behaviors like alcohol and drug abuse become more common, as with depression and suicide. Unintended pregnancies and STIs are a concern. Physical and sexual abuse is also a concern.
- Homeless individuals can be met through avenues such as outreach programs. Initial health care visits should be done with a nonjudgmental, nonthreatening approach. Focus on reported symptoms to encourage adherence and follow-up. They may not adhere to medical treatment recommendations and therefore should require close follow-up as much as possible. Medications with risk for abuse and addiction should be avoided. Subsequent care should focus on health maintenance, attention to common problems and concerns, and establishing an emergency contact person if available.

Homeless individuals experience limited access to health care, problems with food, difficulty with safety, violence, stress, unsanitary living conditions, extreme exposure to weather. This leads to health problems including:
1. Dental problems
2. Malnutrition
3. STIs including HIV and AIDS
4. Lung diseases, including bronchitis, tuberculosis, and pneumonia.
5. Infectious and communicable diseases.
6. Mental health problems
7. Substance abuse problems
8. Wounds and skin infections
## Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Individuals and Families
