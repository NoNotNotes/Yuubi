# Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)
- **Clinical Manifestations**: ==chronic cough, sputum production, DOE==, and progressive; weight loss.
- **Medical Management**: smoke cessation, bronchodilators/corticosteroids
- **Nursing Assessment**: determine current symptoms.
- **Nursing Management**:
	- **Achieving Airway Clearance**: Monitor for dyspnea and hypoxemia, pharmacologic therapy, measure expiratory flow rates and volumes; postural drainage, chest physiotherapy
	- **Improving Activity Tolerance**
	- **Improve Breathing Patterns**
	- **Monitor for Complications**'
## Emphysema
Abnormal distention of the airspaces -> destruction of the walls of the alveoli. Due to its resultant appearance, it is termed as the "**Pink Puffer**" disease.
- **Clinical Manifestations**: barrel chest, severe dyspnea, thin-framed body
- **Diagnostics**: incentive spirometry, CXR, hyperinflation + flattened diaphragm, arterial blood gases (mild-mod hypoxemia, respiratory acidosis)
## Chronic Bronchitis
The presence of cough and sputum daily for at least 3 months in at least two consecutive years. Inflammation and sputum production results in increased mucus-secreting cells, and further increases mucus production. Blockage of the airways reduces ciliary function. Due to its resultant appearance, it is termed as the "**Blue Bloater**" disease.
- **Clinical Manifestations**: chronic productive cough, weight gain, elevated hemoglobin (compensatory), wheezing, peripheral edema
- **Diagnostics**: incentive spirometry, arterial blood gases (mild-mod hypoxia, respiratory acidosis), at least 3 months of daily chronic coughing in two consecutive years.
- **Complications**: RSHF, Pneumonia, Pneumothorax
## Emphysema and Chronic Bronchitis
- **Nursing Management**: low flow oxygen (2-3 L/min) via a Venturi mask; semi-/high-fowler's position; teaching pursed-lip breathing; chest physiotherapy
- **Pharmacologic Management**: bronchodilators (beta-2 agonists, anticholinergics), steroids, methylxanthines
- **Dietary Management**: high calorie, high protein diet
## Bronchiectasis
A chronic, irreversible dilatation of the bronchi and bronchioles. It may be caused by various processes (airway obstruction, airway injury, infections, genetic disorders, abnormal host defenses, idiopathy.
- **Clinical Manifestations**: consistent productive cough, dyspnea, and rales/crackles.
- **Diagnostics**: ABG (hypoxemia), Bronchoscopy
- **Nursing Management**: force fluids, low-flow oxygen, CBR, COPD medications
## Bronchial Asthma
Hyperresponsivity of the lungs in mucosal edema and production.
- **Clinical Manifestations**: coughing, wheezing, and dyspnea (triad); bronchospasm causes difficulty in exertion and may progress, leading to central cyanosis and hypoxia.
	- A continuous reaction is *status asthmaticus*, a potentially fatal state.
	- Accompanying allergic manifestations along with asthma: rashes, eczema, edema.
- **Diagnostics**: family, environmental, and occupational history; in acute episodes, sputum/blood tests, pulse oximetry, ABG (hypocapnia and respiratory alkalosis) and pulmonary function tests
- **Medical Management**: mainly pharmacologic. Long-acting control and quick-relief medications are available: short-acting beta-adrenergic agents, anticholinergics, corticosteroids, methylxanthines.
- **Nursing Management**: assess respiratory status (breath sounds, flow rate, pulse oximetry, vital signs), assess family history of pharmacologic allergies, teach self-care.
