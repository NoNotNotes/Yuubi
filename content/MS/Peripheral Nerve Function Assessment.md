Frequent neurovascular assessment is required for musculoskeletal disorders, especially from [[B316/15-7|fractures]] due to the risk of nerve and muscle anoxia and necrosis. 
# Indicators of Peripheral Neurovascular Dysfunction
1. **Circulation**:
	- **Color**: pale, cyanotic, or mottled
	- **Temperature**: cool
	- **Capillary Refill**: more than 3 seconds
2. **Motion**: weakness, paralysis
3. **Sensation**: paresthesia, unrelenting pain, pain on passive stretching, absence of feeling

# Assessing for Peripheral Nerve Function
Evaluation of sensation and evaluation of motion. The nurse may perform one or all of the following during a musculoskeletal assessment:

| Nerve        | Test of Sensation                                                                      | Test of Movement                                                                                                     |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Peroneal** | Prick the skin midway between the great and second toe (second intrametatarsal space). | Ask the patient to **dorsiflex** the foot and **extend the toes**                                                    |
| **Tibial**   | Pick the medial and lateral surface of the sole.                                       | Ask the patient to **plantar flex the toes and foot**.                                                               |
| **Radial**   | Prick the skin midway between the thumb and the second finger.                         | Ask the patient to **stretch out the thumb**, then the **wrist**, and **then the fingers** at the metacarpal joints. |
| **Ulnar**    | Prick the **distal fat pad** of the **small finger**.                                  | Ask the patient to **abduct all fingers**.                                                                           |
| **Median**   | Prick the top or **distal surface** of the **index finger**.                           | Ask the patient to **touch the thumb to the little finger**. Observe whether the patient can **flex the wrist**.     |
