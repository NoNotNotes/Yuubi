**Oxygenation** is the distribution of oxygen to the body's cells via **internal** and **external respiration**.

## Heart
A cone-shaped, hollow, muscular organ location in the mediastinum between the lungs. It pumps ~5L/min (Cardiac Output) or ~60mL/beat (Stroke Volume).
- It is covered by a thin covering called the pericardium, made up of the parietal pericardium, the visceral pericardium, and the pericardial cavity/space that sits in between them, containing pericardial fluid normally around ~20mL.
- There are three layers of cardiac muscle tissue: the epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium (from outermost to innermost).

### Chambers and Valves of the Heart
1. **Right Atrium**: entry point of unoxygenated blood into the heart from the SVC, IVC, and Coronary Sinuses.
	- Exit Point: **tricuspid valve** (*when closing, it produces S1*)
2. **Right Ventricle**: exits into pulmonary circulation.
	- Exit Point: **pulmonary semilunar valve** (*when closing, produces S2/P2*)
3. **Left Atrium**: entry point of oxygenated blood into the heart from the four pulmonary veins.
	- Exit Point: **mitral/bicuspid valve** 
4. **Left Ventricle**: exits into systemic circulation.
	- Exit Point: **aortic semilunar valve** (*when closing, produces S2/A2*)

### Coronary Artery Disease
The **coronary arteries** are the main oxygen supply of the heart. When they are blocked by plaque formed from deposition and damage caused by fat/lipids, **atherosclerosis** occurs, which leads to **angina pectoris**, where the oxygen supply and oxygen demand of the heart is mismatched. This leads to necrosis, which leads to **myocardial infarction**.

1. **Left Coronary Arteries**
	- **Left Anterior Descending Artery** (LADA): supplies the LV and Ventricular Septum, Chordae Tendinea, Papillary Muscle, and to a lesser extent, the RV.
	- **Circumflex Coronary Artery**: supplies the LA, Lateral and Posterior Surfaces of the LV, Some of the Ventricular Septum, and the SA/AV Nodes.
2. **Right Coronary Artery**: supplies the RA, RV, and the lower portion of the LV.

### Electrophysiologic Properties of the Heart
1. **Automaticity**: spontaneous and automatous repetitive impulse.
2. **Excitability**: depolarization, the response to a stimulus.
3. **Conductivity**: transmission of impulses across the heart.
4. **Contractility**: physical contractile ability of the heart.
5. **Refractoriness**: inability to respond until repolarization.
6. **Elasticity**/**Distensibility**: ability of the heart to compensate increased pressure and volume.
7. **Rhythmicity**: standard and continuous repolarization and depolarization of the heart.

### Conduction System of the Heart
1. **Sinoatrial Node**: the pacemaker of the heart (because it's the fastest), which sends impulses at around 60 to 100 BPM, the normal adult heart rate.
	- Sends impulses to the two atria (via the internodal tracts) initiating their contractions (P Wave).
	- The impulse also reaches the AV Node, where the impulse is delayed to wait for the atria to finish contracting.
2. **Atrioventricular Node**: secondary pacemaker if the SA Node fails, sending impulses at around 40 to 60 BPM.
3. **Bundle of His** 
4. **Right and Left Bundle Branches**
5. **Purkinje Fibers**: ends in ventricular depolarization (QRS Complex)

> [!NOTE]
> Disturbances in the conduction system of the heart is called "**Heart Block**".

### Mechanical Properties of the Heart
1. **Cardiac Output**: the product of an individual's **heart rate** and **stroke volume** ($\text{HR}\times\text{SV}$).
	- Increased by stimulation of the autonomous nervous system and increased release of endogenous catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine).
	- Decreased by the parasympathetic nervous system (vagus nerve), Beta-Adrenergic Blockers (-olols), Calcium Channel Blockers (-dipines), Digitalis (Digoxin).
2. **Stroke Volume**: amount of blood pumped in one beat of the heart.
	- **Preload**: the amount of blood distending the ventricles just before contraction.
	- **Afterload**: the resistance the ventricles must overcome to eject blood.
	- **Contractility**
