title: Introduction to Nursing Leadership and Management
---
**Management** is a universal process used in business, the practice of one's profession, and even day-to-day personal affairs. It coordinates and supervises personnel (or the self) and available resources effectively and efficiently to accomplish organizational goals. **Leadership** (arguably a function of management) is the use of the self as an influencer (**Leader**) of a group to function together to achieve common goals and objectives.

# Nursing Management
Management is an old French term meaning "*the directing*". Along with the aforementioned definition, it is also used to design and maintain an internal environment in which people work together in groups that can perform effectively and efficiently towards the attainment of group goals. It may be used in running a business, in practicing one's profession, and even day-to-day interactions.

>[!CITE] Venson (2010)
>Management is a process by which a cooperative group directs actions towards common goals, involving techniques with which a distinguished group of people coordinates the services of people. It also includes moral and ethical standards in the selection of right ends towards which managers should strive.

**Harbinzon and Myers** created a **Three-Fold Concept to Emphasize the Broader Scope of Management**:
1. **Economic Source**: one of the factors of production, together with land, and capital. Industrialization increases, management is substituted by labor and capital. Management of a firm determines, to a large extent, its productivity and profitability.
2. **System of Authority**: management first develops with top individuals determining the course of action for the rank and file. The constitutional management emphasizes definite and consistent concern for policies and procedures in dealing with the working group. A line towards a democratic and participative approach follows as employees receive higher education.
3. **Class and Status System**: from a sociologist's point of view, managers become an elite group of brains and education. This class is based on education and knowledge. Managers continue to expand their horizons in an effort to attain the ultimate in life or goal.
## Theories of Management
### Scientific Management Theory
**Frederick W. Taylor**, the "*father of scientific management*", postulated that workers could be taught "one best way to accomplish a task", and that productivity would increase. He called these principles *scientific management*. This theory employs four principles:
1. **Traditional "*Rule of Thumb*"**: work organization must employ scientific methods. Workers must be given an adequate amount of time in accomplishing their task.
2. **Workers can be hired, trained, and promoted** based on their **competence and abilities**.
3. **Employees are entitled to receiving financial rewards**, and incentives for worked accomplishments because Taylor viewed humans as "*economic animals*" motivated solely by money.
4. **Maintain good interpersonal relationships** between workers and managements. They should be cooperative and interdependent, with the work shared equally.

Taylor's system of work improvement utilized the following steps:
- **Controlled observation** of the worker's performance through time and motion studies
- **Scientific selection of the best workers for each job, and training for the job task**.
- **Paying the worker** to a differential rate
- **Appointing a few of the most highly skilled workers as managers** to plan and prepare the task of workers.
- **Appointing foremen** (supervisors) **for each aspect of the work**.
#### Gilbreth's Job Simplification
**Frank Gilbreth** and **Lillian Gilbreth** (the "*first lady of management*") were among the first to use motion-picture films to analyze worker's motion. They emphasized the **benefits of job simplification** and the **establishment of work standards**, as well as the effects of the **incentive wage plans** and **fatigue** on work performance.
#### Gantt Charting
Created by **Henry Gantt**, a student of Taylor, a Gantt chart is a timeline for tracking aspects of a project. Gantt advocates for humanitarian management, and is concerned with problems of efficiency. He contributed to scientific management by refining previous work rather than introducing new topics.
### Classical Organization Theories
#### Fayol's Principles of Management and Management Process
Also read: [[Nursing Leadership and Management by Luansing#Management Process]]
**Henry Fayol** is known as the "*father of the management process school*". He studied the functions of the managers and concluded that **management is universal**. There are **fourteen principles of management**:
1. **Division of work**
2. **Authority and Responsibility**
3. **Discipline**
4. **Unity of Command**
5. **Unity of Direction**
6. **Subordination of Individual Interest to General Interest**
7. **Remuneration of Personnel**
8. **Balance of Centralization and Decentralization**
9. **Scalar Chain/Chain of Command**
10. **Order**
11. **Equity**
12. **Stability of Tenure of Personnel**
13. **Initiative**
14. **Esprit de Corps** (*Team Spirit*)

The **management process** consists of:
- **Planning**: the determination of philosophy, goals, objectives, policies, procedures, and rules.
- **Organizing**: establishing the organizational structure to carry out plans, e.g. determining the most appropriate type of patient care delivery.
- **Staffing**: recruiting, interviewing, hiring, and orienting staff
- **Directing**: motivating, conflict resolution, delegating, communicating, and collaborating.
- **Controlling**: performance appraisals, fiscal accountability, quality control, legal and ethical control.

#### Max Weber's Types of Authority
The *father of organizational management*. Webber conceptualized **three types of authority**:
1. **Traditional Authority**: legitimacy based on long-standing cultural traditions e.g. monarchies.
2. **Charismatic Authority**: authority produced as a by-product of extraordinary personality and charisma.
3. **Rational Authority**: power based on legislature and established rules and regulations.

#### Lyndall Urwick's Organizational Theory
She combined the theories of Taylor and Fayol to develop the classic organizational theory. She popularized the term "**span of control and unity of command**"

## Human Relation Management
1. **Mary Parker Follett** (1926) is one of the first theorists to suggest basic principles of what today would be called *participative decision making* or *participative management*. She believed that **managers should have authority with one another, rather than over employees**. She postulates that this leads to better solution-finding and greater employee satisfaction without dominating one or the other.
2. **Elton Mayo** and his Harvard associates conducted a study done at the Hawthorne Works of the Western Electric Company near Chicago, where they found that **special attention given to workers results in increased productivity**, regardless of environmental conditions. Because of its location, this change in behavior when an individual is aware they are being observed is called the **Hawthorne Effect**, which is also an important consideration in research.
3. **Jacob Moreno** developed a system of pairings called **Sociometry**, which states that people are either attracted to, repulsed by, or simply indifferent with other individuals. Often this is done simply by surveying each individual which coworker they would prefer (or not prefer) to work with.
## Behavioral Science
1. **Abraham Maslow** developed the **Hierarchy of Needs**, which states that individuals will only focus on higher level needs when lower level needs are satisfied.
	- Physiologic Needs > Safety and Security Needs > Love and Belonging Needs > Self-Esteem Needs > Self-Actualization
2. **Frederick Herzberg** developed the **Motivator-Hygiene Theory**, a theory that identifies **motivators** which increase satisfaction and productivity; and **hygiene factors** which do not produce satisfaction, but is required to avoid dissatisfaction.
	- **Motivators**: achievement, recognition, advancement, creativity, variety, independence, interesting work, responsibility, accomplishment, personal development, interpersonal relationships, status
	- **Hygiene Factors**: salary and benefits, job security, work environment, job policies, supervisory practices, company policies and administration, company reputation
3. **William Ouchi** developed **Theory Z**, by comparing Japanese organizations to American organizations. It is a *blend* of both management philosophies.
4. **Douglas McGregor** (1960) theorizes that managerial attitude may be related to employee satisfaction. There are two contrasting theories; **Authoritarian** (Theory X) and **Participative** (Theory Y).
	- If team members dislike their work and have little motivation, an *authoritarian approach* may be used. This may involve micromanaging and a "hands-on" position.
	- If team members take pride in their work and see it as a challenge, a *participative approach* may be used. Trust in the members is required.
5. **William Blake**'s **Managerial Grid** is a graph to allow for managers to determine their management style. The two axes of the graph denote **concern for productivity** (horizontal) and **concern for people** (vertical). It is divided into four quadrants, named according to their styles:
	- **Impoverished Management**: A low concern for both productivity and people. It is the most ineffective in meeting people's needs and generating positive results for the organization. Disharmony and conflict arise.
	- **Country Club Management**: A low concern for productivity, but high concern for people. They trust people to manage themselves, so they may not provide adequate direction and coaching. Productivity may suffer, but they believe happy people will work hard and generate good results for the company.
	- **Authority-Compliance/Produce-or-Perish Management**: A high concern for productivity, but low concern for people. Impressive results may be reached using strict rules and punitive measures, but these adversely affect team morale and motivation, eventually resulting in a decline in quality and timeliness of desired results.
	- **Middle-of-the-Road Management**: A moderate concern for both productivity and people. A lack of prioritization for either aspect may result in ineffectivity.
	- **Team Management**: A high concern for both productivity and people. A positive work environment where people feel respected, seen, and heard is created. The workers are motivated and inspired to give their best effort, and productivity improves. Absenteeism and turnover is also reduced in this management style.

## Contemporary Management
1. A **contemporary approach** denotes new, recent, or current approaches in a field of management, e.g. a "contemporary approach in steel manufacturing management" may refer to approaches used by other steel companies in the present day.
2. A **contingency approach** gives way for differences between organizations and situations (contingencies) and thus different approaches to management. It assumes there is no single way to best manage a system. The environment impacts the organization, and **managers must be flexible to consider environmental changes**. The way the organization and control systems are created depends on the environment. A common aspect of the environment that changes frequently and rapidly is technology. Contingencies include:
	- Circumstances in the organization's external environment
	- The internal strengths and weaknesses of the organization
	- The values, goals, skills, and attitudes of managers and workers in the organization.
	- The types of tasks, resources, and technologies the organization uses.
3. A **systems approach** views an organization as a set of interrelated and interdependent parts arranged in a manner that produces a unified whole. It also follows the principle of "there is no one best way to manage".
	- **Closed System**: systems that are not influenced by, nor interacts with the environment.
	- **Open System**: systems that interact with their environment.

## Levels, Skills, and Roles of a Manager
There are various **levels of management**:
1. **Top-Level Manager**: an individual who looks at the **overall** operation of the organization. They coordinate internal and external affairs of the organization; makes major decisions; determines the organization's vision and vision statement, philosophy, policies, and procedures; and creates goals and allocates resources.
2. **Middle-Level Manager**: coordinates activities of **different departments**. They receive policies from the top-level manager, and makes specific objectives and programs.
3. **First-Level Manager**: directly acts for the **actual production of services**, acting as links between higher-level managers and **non-managers**.

A manager should have these skills according to **Robert L. Katz** (Katz's Three Skills):
1. **Technical Skill**: knowledge and proficiency for methods, procedures, and processes.
2. **Human Skill**: ability to work with other people for a harmonious working relationship.
3. **Conceptual Skill**: ability to see the overall picture, identify important elements, and their relationships; identifying pertinent factors; and responding to big problems.

**Summer** also puts forth the following factors:
1. **Knowledge Factor**: ideas, concepts, or principles that can be expressed and are accepted through logical proofs.
2. **Attitude Factor**: beliefs, feelings, and values that may be used on emotions and may not be subjected to conscious verbalization.
3. **Ability Factor**: skill, art, judgment, and wisdom; abstract factors that can direct one's thinking to factors that can be developed by the individual manager who takes time to consider them.

Managers take on various **roles**:
1. **Interpersonal Role**: the manager takes on a position as a:
	- **Symbol**: the leader occupies and consists of such duties e.g. signing papers and documents required by the organization.
	- **Leader** who hires, trains, encourages, fires, remunerates, and judges.
	- **Liaison Officer** between outside contacts e.g. the community, and suppliers
2. **Informational Role**: the manager handles information and its distribution, and acts to:
	- **Disseminate information** from external and internal sources
	- **Monitor information**
	- be a **Spokesperson or representative** of the organization
3. **Decisional Role**: a manager takes on the responsibility of decision making, acting as a:
	- **Problem Solver**/**Troubleshooter**, handling unexpected situations such as resignation of subordinates or loss of clients.
	- **Innovator/Entrepreneur** to improve projects; directs and controls changes in the organization.
	- **Negotiator** in conflict states.

# Nursing Leadership
A job title alone does not make a person a leader. Only a person's **behavior** determines if they hold a leadership role. While the manager brings things about, the leader **influences** and **guides**. There are various definitions for leadership:
- A process of **influence** in which the leader influences others **towards goal achievement**.
- The process of **influencing** the activities of an organized group in its efforts toward **goal setting and goal achievement**.
- Leadership is about **creating change**. It involves **establishing a direction, aligning people through empowerment, motivating and inspiring them toward producing useful change and achieving the mission**.
- Leadership is the vital ingredient that **transforms a crowd into a functioning, useful organization**.
>[!INFO] In the context of Nursing,
>Nursing leadership is the process whereby a nurse influences one or more persons to achieve a specific goal in the provision of quality nursing care.
## Theories of Leadership
### Leadership Styles (Hersey and Blanchard)
1. **Directing Style**: a high-task, low-relationship style effective when subordinates are low in motivation and ability.
2. **Coaching Style**: a high-task, high-relationship style effective when subordinates have adequate motivation but low ability.
3. **Supporting Style**: a low-task, high-relationship style effective when subordinates have adequate ability but low motivation.
4. **Delegating Style**: a low-task, low-relationship style effective when subordinates are very high in ability and motivation.
### Transactional Theory
### Behavioral Theory
### Leadership Styles (Kurt Lewin)
Lewin along with White and Lippitt identified the following common leadership styles:
1. **Authoritarian Leadership**: 
2. **Democratic**/**Participative Leadership**: 
3. **Laissez-Faire Leadership**:
