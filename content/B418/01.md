This page is based on three different discussions from three professors. I tried my best to keep it cohesive while being comprehensive.
___
**Critical Care Nursing** is the delivery of **specialized care** for the seriously-ill clients from the point of injury or illness until discharge from intensive care. This deals with **human responses to life-threatening problems** (AACN) and comprehensive, specialized, and individualized nursing services. It aims for survival and restoring **quality of life**, and helping families of the critically-ill in coping with stress. Critical Nurses take on the roles of **Caregivers**, **Educators** (facilitator of education for patients, family, and staff), **Managers**, **Critical Thinkers**, **Team-Players** (collaborator) and **Advocates** (work on behalf of the patient). They work to:
1. Care for clients who are very ill or at risk for potential life-threatening health problems. These include: **major surgery post-operative clients**, **illness involving the vital organs**, and even **stable clients with signs of impending doom**. They may be classified as the following:
	- **Level 0**: Patients in normal ward care
	- **Level I**: Patients  at risk of deteriorating
	- **Level II**: Patients that require more observation or intervention
	- **Level III**: Patients with multi-system failure
2. Provide one-to-one care
3. Are responsible for making life-and-death decisions
4. Are at risk for injury and illness
5. Utilize **effective communication skills**
## Responsibilities of a Critical Care Nurse
1. **Assessment**: constant assessment of patients for subtle changes and monitoring of equipment.
2. **Planning**: the patient's psychological and physiological needs are considered and realistic (SMART) goals are set.
3. **Implementation**: carrying out specific interventions to address existing and potential patient problems.
4. **Evaluation**: continuing evaluation of response to interventions and revision of the plan care plan to continue working towards goals.

(*According to Dr. Rotairo*)
Nurses are responsible for efficient individualized **continuous** care, specifically continuous monitoring, recording, infection control, and knowledge advancement with research and EBP.
- Keeping the emergency cart available and stocked
- Maintaining **vigilance** to meet the changing needs of the client, promoting the best health outcomes in a caring, competent manner to ensure positive optimal outcomes for the clients and families.
- Counselling
- Observation of **core competencies**: patient care, medical knowledge, professionalism, ethics, interpersonal communication skills, practice-based learning and improvement, system-based practice, clinical judgment, advocacy, response to diversity, clinical inquiry.

# Critical Assessment Process
Critical care requires **Continuous Monitoring and Treatment**, **High Intensity Therapy**, **Export Surveillance and Efficiency**, and **Alertness for Early Manifestations of Progress or Deterioration**. There are four stages in the assessment framework: pre-arrival assessment, admission quick check, comprehensive admission assessment, and on-going assessment.
## Pre-Arrival Assessment
**Pre-Arrival Assessment** begins when the patient is enroute to the ICU, from the ward, operating room, or emergency room. It is an abbreviated report on the patient to determine the possible picture of the client and their needs.
1. **Assess the Patient**: age, gender, chief complaint, diagnosis, pertinent history, physiologic status, invasive devices, equipment, and laboratory tests.
2. **Assess the Environment**: Setup, Functional Equipments, ECG and Electrodes, Sphygmomanometer, Pulse Oximeter, Suction Machine and Catheters, Bag Valve Mask Device, Oxygenation Equipment, IV Poles and Infusion Pumps, Bedside Supply Cart, Admission Kit, and Forms and Care Documentations
	- This may also be subdivided as the mnemonic **FRC**: Fluids, Respiration, and Cardio.
	- **Fluids**: IV pole, IV fluids, infusion pumps, syringe pumps
	- **Respiration**: Suction machine, catheters, bag valve, oxygen, pulse oximeter, ventilator
	- **Cardio**: Electrocardiograph, electrodes, sphygmomanometer, defibrillator, AED
## Admission Quick Check
The initial assessment conducted after the arrival of the patient. It is a quick overview of ventilation (respiratory), circulation (cardiac), and chief complaint (diagnostics) of the patient. Common diagnostic tests include (a) serum  electrolytes, (b) CBG, (c) CBC with platelets, (d) coagulation studies e.g. PTT, PT, (e) ABG, (f) CXR, and (g) ECG.
- **Appearance**
- **Airway**: patency and positioning of artificial airways (if present)
- **Breathing**: quantity and quality of respirations, breath sounds, and presence of spontaneous breathing
- **Circulation**, **Cerebral Perfusion**, and **Chief Complaint**: ECG, blood pressure, peripheral pulses, capillary refill, skin color, skin temperature, skin moisture, presence of bleeding, level of consciousness, and responsiveness.
- **Drugs**: drugs used prior to admission, current medications
- **Diagnostic Tests**: diagnostic test results
- **Equipment**: patency of vascular and drainage systems, equipment functioning, and labeling.
## Comprehensive Admission Assessment
A physiologic and psychosocial assessment as baseline for comparing data for improvement or deterioration.
- **Past Medical History**: medical conditions, laboratory procedures, hospitalisations, medications, allergies, and a review of body systems.
- **Social History**: age, gender, ethnic origin, height, weight, education, occupation, marital status, religion, significant others, history of substance abuse, and history of domestic abuse.
- **Psychological Assessment**: communication, coping styles, anxiety, stress, family needs
- **Spirituality**: faith/preference, spiritual practices
- **Physical Assessment**: nervous system, cardiovascular system, respiratory system, renal system, gastrointestinal system, endocrine system, hematologic system, immune system, and integumentary system:
	- **Nervous System Assessment**: GCS scoring, Pupil Assessment, LOC, Trauma
	- **Cardiovascular System Assessment**: Pulses, Perfusion
	- **Respiratory System Assessment**: Breathing Pattern (rate, rhythm, depth), Breath Sounds, ABG, Secretions
	- **Urinary System Assessment**: urine amount, color, odor, diagnostic tests (UA, BUN, Creatinine)
	- **Gastrointestinal System Assessment**: nutrition, hydration status, contour and symmetry of abdomen.
	- **Integumentary System Assessment**: check overall integrity and presence of ulcers.
## On-going Assessment
The continuing comprehensive assessment done to determine response to therapy, progression of improvement, and outcomes. This is done for as long as the patient remains within the hospital. Frequency of assessment depends on patient stability and risk. Unstable patients are assessed q15min, but stable patients are assessed q2hr or q4hr. **Stability** (ability to maintain equilibrium) may be influenced by:
- **Complexity**: the number of systems implicated in the illness, e.g., a multi-system failure is much more complex than the failure of a single system.
- **Predictability**: expectations of a certain course of events, e.g., increased monitoring for complications after a recent blood transfusion.
- **Vulnerability**: susceptibility to actual or potential stressors.
- **Resiliency**: capacity to return to a restorative level of functioning, e.g., between a 34 year old and an 96 year old patient experiencing the same infectious disease, the old patient may have more frequent assessments.

# Nursing Process in Critical Care
## Nursing Assessment
1. **Nursing History**: rapport-formation and history-taking prior to physical examination that determines patient health status, symptoms, causes of present illness, current management, past medical history, social history, and the patient's perception of illness.
2. **Psychological and Social Examination**: client's perception of illness (again?), emotional health, physical health, spiritual health, and intellectual health.
3. **Physical Examination**: the observation or measurement of signs and symptoms (if observable), and recording of symptoms that are felt by the patient, such as nausea and vertigo. This is done with inspection, palpation, auscultation, and percussion in addition to vital signs taking (temperature, pulse, respiration, blood pressure) and further examination of body systems (cardiovascular, musculoskeletal)
4. **Documentation**: the use of medical or nursing records (paper or electronic) for patient data and care, to be accessed by all members of the health care team.
## Principles in Critical Care Nursing
1. **Anticipation**: the recognition of high-risk patients and anticipation for requirements, complications, and emergencies. The unit should be organized with all necessary equipment and supplies that are mandatory for smooth running of the unit.
2. **Early Detection and Prompt Action**: the prognosis of the patient can highly depend on early detection and intervention against variations. A prime example of this principle is the monitoring of cardiac-respiratory function.
3. **Collaborative Practice**: the critical care team is multidisciplinary; requires very specialized bodies of knowledge. Partnerships are created for decision-making and ensures quality and compassionate patient care. Collaboration is more warranted in critical care than in any other field.
4. **Communication**: [[#Communication in Health Care]]; Intra-professional, inter-departmental, and inter-personal communication has a significant importance in the smooth running of the unit.
5. **Prevention of Infection**: critically ill patients are at a greater risk than other patients due to immunocompromised states with the antibiotic usage and stress, invasive lines, mechanical ventilators, prolonged stay, and severity of illness and environment of the unit itself. **Healthcare-associated infections** (HAI, nosocomial infections) are a major contributor to expenses in health care services.
6. **Crisis Intervention and Stress Reduction**: serving as patient advocates, nurses assist the patient in expressing fear and identify their grieving pattern and provide avenues for positive coping. The bonds between nurses, patients and families are stronger during hospitalization.
## Admission Criteria Models
1. **Prioritization Model**:  the assignment of priority levels to patients based on their presentation:

| Priority Level | Description                                                                                                                     | Care Required                                                                                                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Priority 1** | Critically ill, unstable patients requiring ICU treatment and monitoring.                                                       | Monitoring, ventilator support, continuous vasoactive drug infusions                                            |
| **Priority 2** | Patients potentially requiring immediate intervention, requiring intensive monitoring.                                          | Intensive monitoring                                                                                            |
| **Priority 3** | Critically ill patients with **reduced likelihood of recovery** because of underlying disease or nature of their acute illness. | Palliative care                                                                                                 |
| **Priority 4** | Often not appropriate for ICU admission.                                                                                        | Care required is on an individual basis, under unusual circumstances and at the discretion of the ICU director. |

2. **Objective Parameter Model**: a model that bases ICU admission to observed values:

| Parameter                       | Threshold Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

# Multidisciplinary Teams in Critical Care
Nurses work with critically ill patients commonly collaborate with a multidisciplinary team of health care professionals. A team approach allows for a patient's diverse needs, and include: (a) registered nurses, (b) doctors, (c) physician assistants, (d) advanced practice nurses e.g. clinical nurse specialists and nurse practitioners, (e) patient care technicians, (f) respiratory therapists, and others. They use standardized protocols and guidelines for a consistent approach to all issues, with an emphasis on research, education, ethical issues, and patient advocacy.
- **Rapid Response Teams** (RRTs) was identified as an evidence-based, lifesaving strategy that improves patient outcomes by preventing avoidable patient deaths outside the critical care areas. They mostly consist of a structured group and usually include a **critical care nurse**, a **respiratory therapist**, and possibly a **doctor** who collaborates with the patient's nurse and intervenes appropriately. They may be called upon at 24/7 if concerns about the patient's condition is raised.
___
# Critical Care Unit & Practice Patterns
A **Critical Care Unit** is defined as the unit in which comprehensive care of a critically-ill patient which is deemed to be in recoverable stage is carried out.
>[!INFO]- Types of Critical Care Units
>Neonatal (NICU), special care nursery (SCN), pediatric (PICU), psychiatric (also PICU), coronary care (also CCU), cardiac surgery (CSICU), cardiovascular (CVICU), medical (MICU), medical-surgical (MSICU), overnight intensive recovery (OIR), neuroscience/trauma (also NICU), neurointensive (also NICU), burns (BICU), surgical (SICU), trauma intensive care unit (TICU), shock trauma (STICU), trauma-neuro critical care (TNCC), respiratory (RICU), geriatric (GICU)

A good ICU is well organized with coordinated care, has a full-time intensivist that performs daily rounds, has established protocols and policies, is staffed with bedside nurses (with master degrees) and no interning staff. The team is composed of doctors, nurses, respiratory therapists, and pharmacist, led by full-time intensivists. The unit is availably in a timely fashioned (24/7) with no competing clinical responsibilities. The CCU/ICU is equipped with critical care technology, including:
- ECG monitoring, arterial lines, O<sub>2</sub> saturation, ventilation, ICP monitoring, temperature monitoring, pulmonary artery catheters, IABP, and extensive pharmaceuticals
- ICU bed, cardiac monitoring, IV infusion pump, injection pump, defibrillator, ventilator, crash card (emergency drugs, Ambu-Bag, intubation equipment)
![[critical_care_unit.png]]
>[!INFO]- ICU Design
>ICU organization has various design principles for functioning:
>- Geographically distinct area within the hospital, with controlled access.
>- A single entry and exit, not inclusive of emergency exit points.
>- No through-traffic of goods or hospital staff. Supply and professional traffic should be separated from public/visitor traffic.
>- Safe, easy, fast transport of patients, i.e., it should be in close proximity to the ER, OR, trauma ward, etc. The corridors, lifts, and ramps should be spacious enough to provide easy movement of the bed/trolley of a critically sick patient.
>- Other facilities such as diagnostic facilities, blood bank, pharmacy, etc. should also be in easy proximity.
>- Bed strength (amount) in an ICU should be between 8 to 12 and not less than or not more than 24 in any case, 3-5 beds per 100 hospital beds for a Level III ICU or 2% to 20% of the total number of hospital beds. There is 1 isolation bed for every ICU bed. Each open bed occupies 150 to 200 ft², two feet away from the wall, and eight feet in between beds. Beds are adjustable, have no headboard, with side rails, and wheels.
>- Three O₂ outlets, three suction outlets (gastric, tracheal, and underwater seal), two compressed air outlets, and sixteen power outlets per bed, with bedside storage and hand rinse solution, equipment shelf at the head end, hooks and devices to hang infusions/blood bags from the ceiling with a sliding rail to position, infusion pumps to be mounted on stands or poles, multi-channel invasive monitors (for Level II ICUs).
>- Ventilators, infusion pumps, portable X-ray, fluid and bed warmers, portable light, defibrillators, anesthesia machines and difficulty airway management equipment are necessary.

1. **Open Unit**: any attending physician with hospital admitting privileges can be the physician of record and direct and ICU care.
	- **Disadvantages**: lack of a cohesive plan, inconsistent night coverage, and duplication of services.
2. **Closed Unit**: an intensivist is the physician of record for ICU patients. All orders and procedures are carried out by ICU staff. This is the preferred method for a "good" ICU if resources are available.
	- **Advantages**: improved efficiency and standardized protocols for care.
	- **Disadvantages**: potential to lock out private physicians and increases physician conflict.
3. **Transitional Unit**: intensivists are locally present, and share co-managed care between ICU staff and private caregivers. They share a final common pathway for orders and procedures.
	- **Advantages**: reduce physician conflict, standard policies and procedures are usually present.
	- **Disadvantages**: confusion and conflict regarding **final authority** and responsibilities for patient care decision.

These are *further classified* into levels:
1. **Level I CCU**: provision of monitoring, observation, and short-term ventilation. The **nurse-patient ratio is 1:3**. The staff are not always present in this level.
2. **Level II CCU**: provision of monitoring, observation, and long-term ventilation with resident doctors. The **nurse-patient ratio is 1:2**. Junior medical staff are always present, and consultant medical staff are available if needed.
3. **Level III CCU**: provides all aspects of intensive care including invasive hemodynamic monitoring and dialysis. The **nurse-patient ratio is 1:1**.
## ICU Care Models
1. **Full-Time Intensivist Model**: patient care is provided by an intensivist (physician specialized for critically ill patients)
2. **Consultant Intensivist Model**: an intensivist consults for another physician to coordinate or assist in critical care, but does not have primary responsibility for care.
3. **Multiple Consultant Model**: multiple specialists are involved in the patient care (especially respiratory therapist doctors for ventilators), but none is designated especially as the consultant intensivist.
4. **Single Physician Model**: a primary physician provides all ICU care.

# Communication in Health Care
Communication failures can result in serious adverse effects. Health care professionals must pay close attention to communicating effectively. A structured communication tool, such as **SBAR**, improves the effectiveness of communications, provides a safer environment for patients, and promotes collegial relationships among health care team members. SBAR provides a clear, concise, and effective way to transmit information.

| SBAR               | Content                                         |

>[!QUOTE] A Nurse Calls a Physician and uses the SBAR communication tool
>Dr. Garci, this is Nurse Gloria. I am calling from Fatima University Medical Center about your patient Renato. (**S**) Renato is having increasing dyspnea and is complaining of chest pain. (**B**) He had a total knee replacement two days ago. About two hours ago, he began complaining of chest pain. His pulse is 120 and his blood pressure is 128 over 54. He is restless and short of breath. (**A**) He may be having a cardiac event or a pulmonary embolism. (**R**) I recommend that you see him immediately and that we start him on oxygen stat. Do you agree?

**Closed-Loop Communication** is another applied form of communication where **all details are confirmed by both parties** by having the receiver repeat information back to confirm understanding. This type of communication is used in healthcare to avoid errors:
>[!EXAMPLE] Example of Closed-Loop Communication
>**Physician:** “*Could you give methergine, 0.2 mg IM, now, please?*”

## The Basic Life Support (BLS) Survey
The BLS Survey is a **systematic approach to basic life support** that any trained healthcare provider can perform. This approach stresses **early CPR** and **early defibrillation**. It does not include advanced interventions such as advanced airway techniques or drug administration. It helps achieve goals of supporting or restoring effective oxygenation, ventilation, and circulation until the **Return of Spontaneous Circulation** (ROSC) or initiation of ACLS Interventions.

>[!WARNING] Scene Safety
>If in non-healthcare settings, the initial action should be to ensure **scene safety**. Intervention is ineffective if the intervener is at risk of becoming a victim.

## The Advanced Cardiac Life Support Survey (Pre-Arrest)
The ACLS survey allows for healthcare providers to **continue to assess and perform appropriate actions** until transfer to the next level of care. Assessment and intervention often becomes simultaneous in ACLS scenarios. An important component of this survey is the **differential diagnosis**, where identification and treatment of underlying causes may be critical to patient outcome.
>[!DANGER] Use the BLS Survey first, then ACLS Survey for unconscious patients. In conscious patients, use the ACLS Survey first.

# Cardiac Monitoring
**Cardiac Monitoring** provides continuous observation of the patient's heart rate and rhythm and is a routine nursing procedure in critical care patients. It is common in emergency units, post-anesthesia recovery units, and operating rooms. It often involves an **Electrocardiograph** (ECG), a graphic representation and record of the electrical activity of the heart muscles. The record is a waveform across a grid whose X-axis is time, and Y-axis being the voltage recorded.
- The grid consists of large squares equivalent to 200 milliseconds and 0.5 mV, subdivided further into a 5 by 5 grid whose cells are equivalent to 40 milliseconds and 0.1 mV.
## Normal ECG
|  Component   | Description                                                                                           | Types                     |
| :----------: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
|   **Wave**   | Positive and negative deflections of the wave from the baseline.                                      | P, Q, R, S, T-waves       |
| **Interval** | Durations between two specific ECG events.                                                            | PR, QRS, QT, ST intervals |
| **Segment**  | The length between two specific points on the ECG which are supposed to be at the baseline amplitude. | PR, ST, TP-segment        |
| **Complex**  | The combination of multiple waves group together.                                                     | QRS complex               |
## Defibrillation
1. **Shockable**: ventricular tachycardia without pulse and ventricular fibrillation. Immediately after shocking, CPR is instituted.
2. **Non-shockable**: provision of CPR and epinephrine. This is used for **asystole** and **pulseless electrical activity** (PEA).
## Arrhythmias
**Arrythmias** are abnormal rhythms of the heart. This may be classified as **bradycardia** or **tachycardia**.
1. **Bradycardia**: treated with **Atropine**, given 1 mg every 3 to 5 minutes for a maximum of three doses.
	1. **Sinus Bradycardia**
	2. **Heart Block**
2. **Tachycardia**:
	1. **Narrow QRS**: supraventricular tachycardia (SVT); this may be further classified as unstable (<90 mm Hg) or stable (>90 mm Hg), based on blood pressure.
		- **Unstable SVT** requires sedation with Diazepam (5 mg IV) and a 50J shock.
		- **Stable SVT** requires a vagal maneuver then Adenosine if ineffective (6 mg, then 12 mg IV).
	2. **Wide QRS**: if peaks remain, ventricular tachycardia (VT) or unstable/flattened, ventricular fibrillation (VF).
