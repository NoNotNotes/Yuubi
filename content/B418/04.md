## Arterial Blood Gas Monitoring
ABG monitoring is frequently performed on critically ill patients to assess acid-base balance, ventilation, and oxygenation. The blood gas analyzer determines oxygen tension (PaO<sub>2</sub>), carbon dioxide tension (PaCO<sub>2</sub>), and pH, from which several other parameters are calculated, including base excess (BE), bicarbonate (HCO<sup>-</sup><sub>3</sub>), and oxygen saturation (SaO<sub>2</sub>).

Arterial blood gas samples are obtained by a direct puncture of an artery, usually the radial artery, or by withdrawing blood from an **indwelling arterial catheter system**. A heparinized syringe is used to draw the sample to prevent clotting prior to analysis. The samples are kept on ice unless the sample will be immediately analyzed in order to prevent further shifting of CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> in and out of the red blood cells. Equipment for drawing is usually kept in or near the critical care unit to maximize accuracy and decrease the time for reporting of results.

>[!WARNING] Regardless of the method used to obtain the ABG sample,
>Practitioners obtaining ABG samples should wear gloves and follow universal precautions to prevent exposure to blood during the sampling procedure!

### In-dwelling Arterial Catheters
![[indwelling_arterial_catheter_systems.png]]

These systems provide sites where arterial blood can be withdrawn for analysis. Indwelling syringes, a reservoir, or using a stopcock, a 3- to 5-mL sample is withdrawn to clear the catheter system of any flush system fluid. Afterwards, a 1-mL sample for the ABG analysis is obtained in a heparinized syringe. Any remaining air is removed from the syringe and is capped with an air-tight end. It is placed on ice to ensure accuracy of the measurement. The catheter system is then flushed to clear the line of any residual blood.

Complications with this technique include **infection** and **hemorrhage**. Any time an invasive system is used, the potential exists for contamination of the system. Needleless systems reduce risk for infection and risk for needlestick injuries on behalf of the critical care practitioner. Hemorrhaging is a rare complication, occurring when stopcocks are inadvertently left in the wrong position after blood withdrawal. This can be avoided with proper technique during sampling, limiting sample withdrawal to experienced practitioners, and keeping the pressure alarm system of the bedside monitoring system activated at all times.

### Arterial Puncture
When indwelling arterial catheters are not in place, ABG samples are obtained directly by puncturing the artery with a needle and syringe. The most common sites for arterial puncture are the **radial**, **brachial**, and **femoral arteries**. The technique is simple, but requires experience, similar to a venipuncture.

An **Allen Test** is performed prior to obtaining a sample from the radial artery.
- **Occlude both ulnar and radial pulses for a brief period of time**. The forearm should be **held upward** during this period to **facilitate blood emptying** from the hand.
- Once the hand is **blanched**, the forearm is placed in a downward position, and **the ulnar artery is released**. **Observe the hand for flushing** to determine if the ulnar artery is alone is capable of supplying blood to the fingers if the radial artery is damaged.

Following the location of the pulsating artery and antiseptic preparation of the skin, the needle is inserted into the artery at a **45° angle** with the **bevel facing upward**. The needle is **slowly advanced** until arterial blood appears, or if the insertion depth has went past the artery location.
- If blood is not obtained, withdraw the syringe to just below the skin, relocate and verify the pulsating artery, then advance the needle again.

Once the 1-mL sample has been obtained, the syringe is withdrawn and firm pressure is quickly applied to the insertion site with a sterile gauze pad. **Handheld pressure is maintained for at least 5 minutes and the site is inspected for bleeding or oozing**. If present, **pressure should be reapplied** until all evidence of oozing has stopped. **Pressure dressings are not applied until hemostasis has been achieved**.
- As described, all air should be removed from the ABG syringe and an airtight cap should be applied to the end (remove the needle first).
- It may be better to have another practitioner to aid in preparing the sample, while the other ensures the application of pressure to the site used.

Complications associated with arterial puncture include **arterial vessel tears**, **air embolism**, **hemorrhage**, **arterial obstruction**, **loss of extremity**, and **infection**. Proper technique reduces the occurrence of all of these complications.
- Damage to the artery may be decreased by using a smaller diameter needle (21 to 23 gauge in adults) and by **avoiding multiple attempts at the same site**. After one or two failed attempts at entering the artery, a different site should be selected or another experienced practitioner enlisted to attempt the ABG sampling. Institutional guidelines should be followed.
- Hemorrhaging can occur easily into the surrounding tissues if adequate hemostasis is not achieved with direct pressure. Bleeding into the tissue can range from blood loss with minimal local damage to large blood loss with loss of distal circulation and even exsanguination. Large blood loss is more commonly associated with femoral punctures and is often the result of inadequate pressure on the artery following needle removal. Bleeding from the femoral artery is difficult to visualize, so significant blood loss can occur before practitioners are alerted to the problem. As such, **the femoral artery is the least preferred site for ABG sampling, and is only used when other sites are unavailable**.

If repeated ABG analysis is required, the insertion of an arterial catheter and monitoring system may be required to decrease the risks associated with repetitive arterial punctures.

### Analysis
The best approach to ABG analysis is a systematic one. Analysis is accomplished by evaluating acid-base and oxygenation status. Upon receipt of ABG results, the practitioner first identifies any abnormal values, then a systematic evaluation is done.

Optimal cellular functioning occurs when the pH of the blood is between 7.35 and 7.45. Decreases in pH below 7.35 are termed *acidemia*, and increases in pH above 7.45 are termed *alkalemia*. When the amount of acids or bases in the body increases or decreases, the pH changes if the ratio of acids to bases is altered; for example, if acid production increases and there is no change in the amount of base production, pH decreases. If the base production were to increase as well, as a response to increased acid production, then no change in pH would occur. There are strong systems in place to maintain the balance between acids and bases, even if one of these systems were to become abnormal. There are a variety, but the **bicarbonate** and **carbon dioxide levels** are the primary regulatory systems involved.
1. **Metabolic Component**: Bicarbonate (HCO<sup>-</sup><sub>3</sub>) level are controlled primarily by the kidneys and have been termed as the *metabolic component* of the acid-base system. By increasing or decreasing the amount of bicarbonate excreted in the kidneys, the pH of the blood can be increased or decreased. Changes in excretion **may take up to 24 hours** or longer to accomplish, but **can be maintained for prolonged periods**.
2. **Respiratory Component**: Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) levels are controlled primarily by the lungs and are termed the *respiratory component* of the acid-base system. By increasing or decreasing the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> excreted by the lungs, the pH of the blood can be increased or decreased. This change **can occur rapidly** by increasing or decreasing respirations (minute ventilation). Compensation by the respiratory system is **difficult to maintain over long periods of time** (>24 hours)

1. **Metabolic Alkalemia**: there is either a primary increase in hydrogen ion (H<sup>+</sup>) loss or HCO<sup>-</sup><sub>3</sub> gain. The respiratory system attempts to compensate for the increased pH by decreasing the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> eliminated from the body (*alveolar hypoventilation*). This compensatory attempt by the respiratory system results in a change in pH, but rarely to a normal value.
	- pH is above 7.45 and HCO<sup>-</sup><sub>3</sub> is more than 26 mEq/L.
	- Clinical situations or conditions that cause metabolic alkalemia include: (a) **loss of body acids**, e.g. in nasogastric suctioning of HCl, vomiting, excessive diuretic therapy, steroids, hypokalemia) and (b) **ingestion of exogenous bicarbonate or citrate substances**.
	- **Management** is directed at treating the underlying cause, decreasing or stopping the acid loss (e.g., antiemesis for vomiting), and replacing electrolytes.
2. **Metabolic Acidemia**: there is excessive loss of HCO<sup>-</sup><sub>3</sub> from the body by the kidneys or there is an accumulation of acid. The respiratory system attempts to compensate for the decreased pH by increasing the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> eliminated (*alveolar hyperventilation*). This compensatory attempt by the respiratory system results in a change in pH toward normal.
	- pH is less than 7.35 and HCO<sup>-</sup><sub>3</sub> is less than 22 mEq/L.
	- Clinical situations or conditions that cause metabolic acidemia include (a) **increased metabolic formation of acids** ([[B316/07-4|diabetic ketoacidosis]], uremic acidosis, lactic acidosis), (b) **hyperkalemia**, (c) **toxins** (salicylates overdose, ethylene and propylene glycol, methanol, paraldehyde), and (d) **adrenal insufficiency**.
	- **Management** is directed at treating the underlying cause, decreasing acid formation (e.g., decreasing lactic acid production by improving cardiac output during shock), decreasing bicarbonate losses (e.g., treatment of diarrhea), removal of toxins via dialysis or cathartics, or administering sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) in extreme metabolic acidemia states.
3. **Respiratory Alkalemia**: there is an excessive amount of ventilation (*alveolar hyperventilation*) and removal of CO<sub>2</sub>. If these changes persist for 24 hours or more, the kidneys begin to compensate by increasing bicarbonate excretion until normal or near-normal pH levels return.
	- pH is above 7.45 and PaCO<sub>2</sub> is less than 35 mm Hg.
	- Clinical situations or conditions that cause respiratory alkalemia include (a) **neurogenic hyperventilation**, (b) **interstitial lung diseases**, (c) **pulmonary embolism**, (d) **asthma**, (e) **acute anxiety**/**stress**/**fear**, (f) **hyperventilation syndromes**, (g) **excessive mechanical ventilation**, and (h) **severe hypoxemia**.
	- **Management** is directed at treating the underlying cause and decreasing excessive ventilation if possible.
4. **Respiratory Acidemia**: there is an inadequate amount of ventilation (*alveolar hypoventilation*) and removal of CO<sub>2</sub>. If these changes persist for 24 hours or more, the kidneys begin to compensate by decreasing bicarbonate excretion until normal or near-normal pH levels return.
	- pH is below 7.35 and PaCO<sub>2</sub> is more than 45 mm Hg.
	- Clinical situations or conditions that cause respiratory acidemia include (a) **overall hypoventilation associated with respiratory failure** (e.g., acute respiratory distress syndrome, severe asthma, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, sleep apnea), (b) **pulmonary embolism**, (c) **pulmonary edema**, (d) **pneumothorax**, (e) **respiratory center depression**, (f) **neuromuscular disturbances in the presence of normal lungs**, and (g) **inadequate mechanical ventilation**.
	- **Management** is directed at treating the underlying cause and improving ventilation.
5. **Mixed (Combined) Disturbance** is a simultaneous development of a primary respiratory and metabolic acid-base disturbance; for example, metabolic acidosis may develop from diabetic ketoacidosis, with respiratory acidosis occurring from respiratory failure associated with aspiration pneumonia. These disturbances create a more complex picture when examining ABGs (and are beyond the scope of this text!)

### Oxygenation
After acid-base status has been determined, adequate of oxygenation is assessed. Normal values for PaO<sub>2</sub> depend on the age and altitude. Lower levels of PaO<sub>2</sub> are acceptable as normal with increasing age and altitude levels. In general, PaO<sub>2</sub> levels between 80 and 100 mm Hg are considered normal on room air. If PaO<sub>2</sub> drops below this level results in *hypoxemia*.

SaO<sub>2</sub> levels are also affected by the same factors. 95% or above is considered a normal oxygen saturation. Hemoglobin saturation with oxygen is primarily influenced by the amount of available oxygen in the plasma. In general, as long as PaO<sub>2</sub> levels are above 60 mm Hg, 90% or more of the hemoglobin is bound or saturated with O<sub>2</sub>. Changes in this equivalence may arise from temperature, pH, PaCO<sub>2</sub>, and abnormal hemoglobin conditions.

A variety of conditions may result in hypoxemia:
- *Low inspired oxygen*: occurs when the fraction of inspired oxygen concentration (FiO<sub>2</sub>) is reduced, such as in high altitudes or when toxic gases are inhaled. Inadequate or inappropriately low FiO<sub>2</sub> administration may contribute to hypoxic respiratory failure in patients with other cardiopulmonary diseases.
- *Overall hypoventilation*: decreased tidal volume (V<sub>T</sub>), respiratory rate, or both. This results in reduced alveolar oxygen tension and increased PaCO<sub>2</sub> levels.
	- Respiratory center depression from drug overdose, anesthesia, excessive analgesia, neuromuscular disturbances, and fatigue
- *Ventilation-perfusion mismatch*: when the balance between adequately ventilated and perfused alveoli is altered, hypoxemia develops. Perfusion of blood past underventilated alveoli decreases the the availability of oxygen for gas exchange, leading to poorly oxygenated blood in the pulmonary vasculature.
	- Bronchospasm, atelectasis, secretion retention, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary edema
- *Diffusion defect*: thickening of the alveolar-capillary membrane reduces diffusion.
	- Chronic disease states e.g. pulmonary fibrosis and sarcoidosis
	- Usually responds to supplemental oxygenation
- *Shunt*: blood bypasses or shunts past the alveoli, and gas exchange and oxygenation does not occur.
	- Anatomical defects e.g. pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas, congenital cardiac anomalies of the heart and great vessels such as tetralogy of Fallot
	- Physiologic shunts result from conditions that produce closed, nonventilated alveoli such as is seen in ARDS.
- *Low mixed venous oxygenation*: normally, PmVO<sub>2</sub> does not affect PaO<sub>2</sub> significantly. However, reduced PVO<sub>2</sub> can lower the PaO<sub>2</sub> significantly when either ventilation-perfusion mismatch or intrapulmonary shunting is present.
	- Low CO, anemia, hypoxemia, and increased oxygen consumption.
	- Tissue oxygen delivery by increasing cardiac output or hemoglobin usually improves mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO<sub>2</sub>).

### Pulse Oximetry
Pulse oximetry is a common method for continuous, noninvasive monitoring of SaO<sub>2</sub>. It is easy to use, well-tolerated, and portable. It reduces the need for an invasive arterial puncture, avoiding potential infection risks and blood loss from frequent analysis.

A sensor is applied to skin over areas with strong arterial pulsatile blood flow, typically one of the peripheral fingers or toes, but also optionally the bridge of the nose, ear, and forehead (the forehead sensor is a reflectance sensor and provides a central monitoring site location). The SaO<sub>2</sub> sensor is connected to a pulse oximeter monitor unit via a cable.
- Light-emitting diodes on one side of the sensor transmits light of two different wavelengths (infrared and red) through arterial blood flowing under the sensor. Depending on the level of oxygen saturation, different amounts of light are detected on the other side of the sensor (transmission) or via scattered light on the same side of the light emitters (reflectance).
- This photodetection aspect of the sensor transmits information to the microprocessor within the monitor, which then calculates and displays the oxygen saturation and pulse rate.

When blood perfusion is adequate and SaO<sub>2</sub> levels are greater than 70%, depending on the type of sensor and site, there is generally a close correlation between the saturating reading from the pulse oximeter (SpO<sub>2</sub>) and SaO<sub>2</sub> directly measured from ABGs. In situations where perfusion to the sensor is markedly diminished (e.g., peripheral vasoconstriction due to disease, drugs, or hypothermia), the ability of the pulse oximeter to detect a signal may be less than under normal perfusion conditions. The **major disadvantage** of pulse oximetry is altered accuracy depending on adequate arterial pulsatile signal. Some conditions that may decrease accuracy include:
- Hypotension
- Low cardiac output states
- Vasoconstriction or vasoactive drugs
- Hypothermia
- Movement of the sensor and/or poor skin adherence
- Direct exposure to bright ambient light and certain nail polish applications and treatments.

Some more tips to maximize safety and accuracy of pulse oximetry:
- Apply sensor to dry finger of nondominant hand according to manufacturer's directions and observe for adequate cardiac-based arterial pulse wave generation or signal on pulse oximeter unit.
- Avoid tension on the sensor cable.
- Rotate application sites and change sensor according to manufacturer direction whenever adherence is poor.
- In children and elderly patients, assess application sites more often and carefully assess skin integrity when using adhesive sensors.
- Never use pulse oximeters on non-approved monitoring site locations.
- If pulse wave generation is inadequate, check for proper adherence. Apply a new site to another site, if necessary.
- Compare pulse oximeter displayed SaO<sub>2</sub> values with arterial blood gases periodically, when changes in clinical condition may decrease accuracy or if the values do not fit the clinical situation.
