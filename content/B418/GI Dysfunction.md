# Anatomy and Physiology
The alimentary tract is the main route of nutrition for the human body, and starts from the mouth, through the esophagus, into the stomach, through the small and large intestines, then in the rectum and out the anus. Along with the alimentary canal, additional accessory organs of digestion aid in the digestion of ingested substances.

# Bleeding Disorders
**Gastrointestinal bleeding**, also known as gastrointestinal hemorrhage, involves any form of bleeding along any part of the gastrointestinal tract whether in the mouth or in the rectum. Depending on its location, it may be classified as an **upper GI bleed** or a **lower GI bleed**.
## Upper GI Bleed

| Common Causes              | Percentage |
| -------------------------- | :--------: |
| **Peptic Ulcer Disease**   | 20% – 50%  |
| **Gastroduodenal Erosion** |  8% – 15%  |
| **Esophagitis**            |  5% – 15%  |
| **Varices**                |  5% – 20%  |
| **Mallory-Weiss Tearing**  |  8% – 15%  |
| **Vascular Malformation**  |     5%     |

In upper GI bleeding, the following **symptoms** appear:
1. **Melena** or **Melenic stools**; stool that are black (dark-colored), tarry, and foul-smelling.
2. **Hematemesis**, either **red** (fresh blood) or **coffee-ground** (blood altered by stomach acids and enzymes).
3. **Dyspepsia**
4. **Heartburn** (Pyrosis) or **Epigastric pain**
5. **Abdominal Pain**
6. **Dysphagia**, a difficulty in swallowing
7. **Jaundice** if the liver is implicated
8. **Weight loss** from malabsorption or secondary to loss of appetite
9. **Syncope** or presyncope due to decreased perfusion or decreased blood volume/pressure
10. **Pallor**
## Lower GI Bleed

| Common Causes                | Percentage |
| ---------------------------- | :--------: |
| **Diverticulosis**           | 20% – 65%  |
| **Angioectasia**             | 40% – 50%  |
| **Ischemic Colitis**         |     -      |
| **Hemorrhoids**              |  2% – 5%   |
| **Colorectal Neoplasia**     |     -      |
| **Postpolypectomy Bleeding** |  2% – 8%   |
| **Solitary Rectal Ulcer**    |     -      |
| **Radiation Proctopathy**    |     -      |
- **Diverticulosis** and **angioectasia** account for 80% of adults with LGIB.
- **Infectious colitis** and **inflammatory bowel disease** are the common causes in children.
- Meckel's diverticulum and intussusception are the most common causes of **massive LGIB in children younger than 2 years old**.

In lower GI bleeding, the following **symptoms** appear:
1. **Hematochezia**: fresh blood in stool such as in hemorrhoids or anal fissure.
2. **Bloody Diarrhea**: typical of **colitis**.
3. **Febrile episodes** potentially related to colitis, diverticulitis, or potential infections.
4. **Hypovolemic Shock** or **Dehydration** from severe blood loss.
5. **Abdominal cramps or pain** due to related inflammation, obstruction, or other underlying causes of LGIB.
6. **Hypotension** also from severe blood loss.
7. **Decreased hemoglobin levels** from direct losses in bleeding.
8. **Pallor** from reduced blood volume and subsequent decreased perfusion.
## Diagnostic Examination
1. Determine the **history** of bleeding:
	1. **Duration and quantity**
	2. **Associated symptoms**
	3. **Previous history of bleeding** 
	4. **Current medications** such as anticoagulants and some antibiotics that can contribute to bleeding risks
	5. **Alcohol use**
	6. **NSAID** or **ASA** (aspirin) use, as these medications can result in gastrointestinal bleeding.
	7. **Allergies**
	8. **Associated medical illnesses** such as liver disease, coagulopathies, inflammatory bowel diseases, etc.
	9. **Previous surgery** as potential causes for GI bleeding

>[!FAIL] False Positives
>1. **Diet**: the ingestion of certain fruits (cantaloupe, grapefruit, figs), uncooked vegetables (radish, cauliflower, broccoli), and red meat may produce a blood-like appearance upon emesis or defecation.
>2. **Preparations**: the use of methylene blue, chlorophyll, iodide, cupric sulfate, and bromide preparations can also produce the same effect.

>[!TIP] Hematochezia
>**Hematochezia** (bright red, maroon) often signifies **lower GI bleeding**, or a rapid transit time of an **upper GI bleed** (10% to 15% of patients). A more **proximal source** of significant bleeding must be excluded before assuming the bleeding is from the GI tract.

2. **Physical Examination**:
	1. **Vital signs** and postural changes in heart rate and blood pressure are insensitive and nonspecific. This includes tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension related to bleeding.
	2. **Skin signs** may appear in **shock** (color, warmth, moisture) or **vascular/hypocoagulable diseases** (lesions; telangiectasia, bruises, petechiae)
3. **Rectal Examination**: rectal and stool examinations are often key to making or confirming the diagnosis of GI bleeding. Recognition and management of patients with GI bleeding can start with the finding of **red**, **black**, or **melenic stool**.
4. **Fecal Occult Blood Testing**: testing for the presence of **hemoglobin** in occult amounts in stool confirmed by tests such as **Hemoccult** or **HemaPrompt**. In patients with a single, major episode of UGIB, FOBT returns positive in 14 days.
5. **Hematocrit**: changes in Hct may lag significantly behind actual blood loss. The initial hematocrit may be misleading in patients with preexisting anemia or polycythemia. Additionally, patients without bleeding may exhibit low Hct after a rapid infusion of crystalloid (hemodilution).
6. **Hemoglobin**: a concentration of 8 g/dL or less from acute blood loss often require blood therapy (+3% Hct, +1 mg/dL Hgb per unit of blood)
7. **Coagulation Profile**: PT (prothrombin time) may be elevated, indicating the presence of Vit. K deficiency, liver dysfunction, warfarin therapy, or consumptive coagulopathy.
	- **Serial platelet counts** are used to determine the need for platelet transfusions (>50,000/mm³)
8. **ABG and Electrolyte Balance**: patients with repeated vomiting may develop hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and metabolic alkalosis.
9. **CT Angiography** is the gold standard for the diagnosis of GI bleeding.
10. **Endoscopy**: the use of an endoscope to physically visualize the gastrointestinal tract. This may be done in the form of an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGC; upper GI) or colonoscopy (lower GI).
## Treatment and Management
1. **Quick Identification** is important in preventing complications and implementing early interventions.
2. **Aggressive Resuscitation** may be necessary in severe bleeding to reestablish stable vitals and blood parameters.
	- **Establish good access**: two large-bore (gauge 18) peripheral IVs or a triple-lumen or Cordis catheter if in MICU.
	- **Replace intravascular volume** for patients who are hypotensive and/or orthostatic. (a) **Normal saline** is given as bolus, (b) **PRBCs** are given for anemic patients, and (c) **FFP/Platelets** are given for massive GI bleeds.
	- **Nasogastric Intubation and NG Lavage**: placement and confirmation of placement; flushing the stomach— inject 250 cc NS, then draw 250 cc back, then repeated up to a total of 2L or until fluid withdrawn are clear. This is done to flush out any clots or other contents of the stomach. However, this is **contraindicated** in patients with facial trauma, nasal bone fracture, those with esophageal abnormalities (e.g. strictures, diverticuli), and those who have ingested caustic substances or experienced esophageal burns.
3. **Prompt Consultation**
4. **Pharmacology**:
	1. **Proton Pump Inhibitors** (8 mg/hr with 80 mg loading dose): acidity dissolves blood clots, which can increase bleeding. PPIs reduce gastric acid secretion, promoting the healing of ulcers and erosions as well as stabilizing thrombi.
	2. **Somatostatin Analogues** (Octreotide; 25–50mcg/hr for at least 24 hours). These also reduce gastric secretions, and are used in patients with esophageal varices and acute upper GI bleeding. This may be supplemental to **endoscopic sclerotherapy** (varicose veins are chemically sealed shut).
>[!FIRE] Treatment Regime for *H. Pylori*
>|Regimen|Side Effect Rating|Cure Rate|
>|---|---|---|
>|Clarithromycin + Metronidazole + PPI|Medium|80–90%|
>|Amoxicillin + Clarithromycin + PPI|Medium-Low|80–90%|
>|Amoxicillin + Metronidazole + PPI|Medium|80–90%|
>|Helidac + H₂ Blocker|Medium-High|80–85%|
>|Prevpak|Medium-Low|81–92%|

5. **Surgical Treatment** is dependent on the nature of the cause of bleeding. A particular distinction for methodology is whether or not the bleed is **variceal** in nature. For **non-variceal bleeding**, surgery is reserved for patients with failed medical management. The treatment used depends on the cause, but is commonly performed in the context of a **bleeding peptic ulcer**. See the next section for variceal bleeding.
## Variceal Bleeding
**Variceal bleeding** is suspected in **liver disease or cirrhosis**. It occurs from resultant **portal hypertension** and the development of porto-systemic anastomosis (connection of portal and systemic circulation). Pharmacologic treatment may be used to resolve bleeding before the necessity for radical approaches:
1. **Somatostatin/Octreotide** vasoconstricts splanchnic circulation and reduces pressure in the portal system
2. **Terlipressin**: vasoconstricts splanchnic circulation and reduces pressure in the portal system
3. **Propanolol** as primary prevention for those with varices.

>[!INFO] Balloon Tamponade
>As a rare intervention, a **Sengstaken-Blakemore Tube** is temporarily used as a **balloon tamponade** if endoscopic management fails.

**Surgery** may be done if prior interventions have been ineffective:
1. **Band ligation** physically closes bleeding varices.
2. **Sclerotherapy** shuts off varices through the administration of chemical agents through an **endoscope**.
3. **Transjugular Intrahepatic Porto-Systemic Shunt** (TIPSS) is the placement of a shunt between the hepatic and portal vein to alleviate portal pressure. However, this can worsen hepatic encephalopathy, and is only performed if medical and endoscopic management have been ineffective.
4. **Surgical porto-systemic shunts** (often spleno-renal) alleviates porto-systemic pressure.

**Radiation** may be used to selectively catheterize and embolize vessels feeding the varices, if medical and endoscopic attempts at management have been unsuccessful.

# Traumatic Disorders
Injuries induced by physical damage to the abdomen. These include incidents such as blunt trauma and penetrating injuries. The abdominal cavity contains many organs, including solid organs (liver, spleen, kidney, pancreas, etc.) and hollow organs (GI tract, bladder, appendix, gall bladder, etc.)

| Injury/Finding                                                | Suspected Damage                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Blunt Abdominal Trauma                                        | **Spleen**: most commonly injured organ                                             |
| Referred Left Shoulder Pain                                   | **Splenic Rupture**                                                                 |
| Lower Left Rib Fractures                                      | Splenic Injury                                                                      |
| Blunt and Penetrating Injuries                                | Liver                                                                               |
| Grey-Turner's Sign (bluish discoloration of lower flank/back) | Retroperitoneal bleeding of pancreas, kidney, or pelvis (fracture)                  |
| Cullen Sign (bluish periumbilical discoloration)              | Peritoneal bleeding, common in pancreatic hemorrhage                                |
| Kehr Sign (shoulder pain when supine)                         | Diaphragmatic irritation from splenic injury, free air, or intra-abdominal bleeding |
| Balance Sign (dull percussion in LUQ)                         | Sign of splenic injury; blood accumulating in subcapsular or extracapsular spleen   |
| Labial and Scrotal Sign                                       | Pooling of blood in the scrotum or labia                                            |
| London/Seatbelt Sign                                          | -                                                                                   |

>[!WARNING] Mechanisms of Injury
>1. **Crushing**: direct application of blunt force to the abdomen
>2. **Shearing**: sudden deceleration applying shearing force on attached organ
>3. **Bursting**: raised intraluminal pressure due to compression in hollow organs, resulting in rupture
>4. **Penetration**: the disruption of bony areas by blunt trauma may generate **bony spicules** that can cause secondary penetrating injuries.
## Signs and Symptoms
General findings of abdominal trauma involve mechanisms involved in **blood loss**:
1. **Increased pulse pressure**: loss of total blood volume (≤15%) increases pulse pressure
2. **Rising HR and RR** as blood loss continues
3. **Hypotension** after significant blood loss (30%+ loss)
4. **Abdominal pain**, **fever**, **nausea and vomiting** may take hours to become clinically apparent.

| Injury              | Nature of S/S                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pancreatic Injuries | Subtle signs and symptoms, making diagnosis elusive                                                                                                            |
| Duodenal Injuries   | Clinical signs are slow to develop, commonly occurring after a high-speed vertical or horizontal decelerating trauma.                                          |
| Duodenal Rupture    | Usually contained within the peritoneum                                                                                                                        |
| Pancreatic Injury   | **Rapid deceleration** or a **severe crush injury**, such as unrestrained drivers crashing into a steering wheel or a cyclist falling against their handlebar. |
>[!IMPORTANT] Remember— Pears and Pitfalls of Abdominal Trauma
>1. Abdominal trauma may present with **deceptively unimpressive physical exams**; injuries are *covert*. As such, the details of the mechanism of injury should be elicited in order to provide appropriate management.
>2. **Gunshot penetrating trauma** has a much higher morbidity and mortality compared to a **stab wound**.
>3. **Bedside sonography** is increasingly useful for diagnosing **hemoperitoneum in blunt abdominal trauma**.
>	- The finding of free fluid in Morrison's pouch is pathognomonic for hemoperitoneum.
>
## Assessment
As mentioned, it is important to **determine the details of the trauma experienced by the client**. These guide care and management especially in the absence of clearer indicators:
- **Motor Vehicle Accidents** (MVAs): determine the speed of collision, the positions of each colliding car, the position of the client within the car on impact, the use of a seatbelt, and the extent of car damage.
- **Falls**: height fallen, landing material, body alignment on impact
- **Gunshot Wounds** (GSW): the type of gun used, distance from the shooter, and number of shots heard
- **Stab Wounds**: the type of weapon used

1. The **Primary Survey** can be used as part of the **Advanced Trauma Life Support** (ATLS) **Algorithm**:

| Survey (ABCDE)                      | Content                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Airway with C-Spin Protection       | Is the patient speaking in full sentences?                                                                                                                                                  |
| Breathing and Ventilation           | Is breathing labored? Are breath sounds symmetrical? Does the chest rise with respirations?<br>- Oxygen therapy: nasal cannula, face mask                                                   |
| Circulation with Hemorrhage Control | Are pulses present and symmetric? Does the skin appear normal, warm, and well perfused?<br>- Establish two large bore (18 gauge) antecubital IVs for resuscitation<br>- Monitor the patient |
| Disability                          | What is the patient's GCS scale? Are they able to move all of their extremities?                                                                                                            |
| Exposure/Environmental Control      | Completely expose the patient. How is the rectal tone? Is there gross bleeding through the rectum?                                                                                          |

2. Following an **intact primary survey**, **adjunct interventions** and **resuscitation** may begin. Adjunct interventions include the following as necessary: EKG, ABG, CXR, Pelvis X-ray, Urinary Catheterization, E-FAST Exam, and/or DPL.
	- E-FAST and/or DPL are used to determine hemoperitoneum. Bedside sonography may be used.
3. The **Secondary Survey** includes a complete history and physical examination, done after the primary survey and once vital functions are returning to normal. An **AMPLE**  history is taken:
	- **Allergies**
	- **Medications**
	- **Past Medical History**
	- **Last Meal**
	- **Events Surrounding Injury**
4. **System-based Assessment**:
	1. **Abdomen**: inspection, auscultation, percussion, palpation; find all wounds, ecchymosis, deformities, entry and exit wounds (penetrating trauma), and any evisceration.
	2. **Perineum, Rectum, Genitalia**: all are examined
	3. **Rectum**: examined for a high-riding prostate, lack of rectal tone, or heme-positive stools.
## Diagnostic Examination
1. **Chest Radiograph**: visualization of the thoracic cavity, especially useful for evaluating for **herniated abdominal contents** and **free air** under the diaphragm.
2. **Anteroposterior Pelvis Radiograph**: identify **pelvic fractures** (associated with significant blood loss, intra-abdominal injury)
3. **Ultrasonography**: a focused assessment for a **focused assessment with sonography for trauma** (FAST) examination. This is a widely accepted **primary diagnostic study** done by trained doctors, surgeons, or radiologists.
	- **Free intraperitoneal fluid** is associated with many clinically significant injuries. This is also found in hypotensive patients with blunt abdominal trauma.
	- **Serial FAST examinations** can determine the rate of hemorrhage; this method has essentially replaced **diagnostic peritoneal lavage** (DPL) for blunt abdominal trauma.
>[!WARNING] Diagnostic Peritoneal Lavage
>A DPL is now a second-line screening test with the use of CT and Bedside Ultrasound. It is used in blunt trauma, and can be used for:
>- Patients who are **severely hemodynamically unstable** and are unable to leave the ED for a CT
>- Patients with an equivocal physical examination, but with **unexplained hypotension**.
>
>...but is **absolutely contraindicated** if surgical management is clearly indicated. A DPL would only delay treatment. Other conditions such as advanced hepatic dysfunction, severe coagulopathies, and previous abdominal surgeries or a gravid uterus may be considered as contraindications.
>
>The result of a DPL is considered positive if any of the following are true:
>1. More than 10 mL of gross blood is aspirated immediately
>2. The red blood cell count if higher than 100,000/mm³
>3. The white blood cell count is higher than 500/mm³
>4. Bile is present
>5. Vegetable matter is present

4. **Computed Tomography Abdominopelvic CT with IV Contrast**: a non-invasive **gold standard** study for the diagnosis of abdominal injury. Its major advantage over X-ray is its precision in locating and grading an injury, as well as quantifying and differentiating free intraperitoneal fluid. This is the **==ideal study to evaluate for retroperitoneal injuries==**. Contrast may be given through IV, by mouth, or rectum

| IV                                                                                                                  | Oral                                                                                                                                          | Rectal                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Contrast is injected into a vein through a small needle                                                             | Used to enhance CT images of the abdomen and pelvis                                                                                           | Used to enhance CT images of the larger intestines and other organs in the pelvis                |
| Used to highlight blood vessels and to enhance the tissue structure of various organs such as the liver and kidneys | 1. Barium sulfate is the most common oral contrast agent used in CT<br>2. Gastrografin is a secondary contrast agent                          | For rectal CT contrast (barium and gastrografin, same as oral) but with different concentrations |
| Blood vessels and organs filled with the contrast to "enhance" and show up as white areas on the x-ray or CT images | Travels into the stomach and then into the gastrointestinal tract. These absorb CT or X-ray waves, differentiating them in the produced image | Outlining the large intestines (colon)                                                           |

>[!IMPORTANT] Outcomes
>1. All patients with **identifiable injuries** on imaging or DPL should be admitted or transmitted to a hospital or trauma center for further inpatient monitoring and care.
>2. Patients with **no injuries and continued abdominal pain** are admitted for observation and serial abdominal exams.
>3. Patients with **no injuries** and a benign physical exam can be discharged to home with instructions for indications to return to the facility.

## Management
In acute trauma, it is important to perform **aggressive resuscitation**, **control bleeding**, and ensure that patients are **fully resuscitated** and to reduce the incidence and severity of **organ failure**. Then, **==surgery==** can be used to limit further damage and repair damaged tissues. Operations are *tailored* to the patient's physiology, and procedures may be *staged* in order to prevent physiological exhaustion.

>[!ERROR] Massive Transfusion Complications
>1. **Hypothermia**: blood products are chilled in storage. When used for rapid infusion, this may cause significant hypothermia. To counteract this complication, **blood warmers are routinely used for rapid transfusions** at ~50 mL/kg/hr in adults or 15 mL/kg/hr in children.
>2. **Electrolyte Imbalance**: citrate anticoagulants in stored blood can cause toxicity— citrate may bind Mg2+, causing arrhythmias, affect ionized plasma Ca2+, and K+ levels. **ECG monitoring** is important to determine electrolyte levels.
