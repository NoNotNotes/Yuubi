title: Ethical and Legal Considerations in Critical Care Nursing
---
There are four **foundations for ethical decision making**:
1. **Professional Codes and Standards** e.g. the Philippine Nurse's Act (R.A. 9173), the Nuremberg Code, etc.
2. **Institutional Policies**
3. **Legal Standards** e.g. the Patient's Bill of Rights, the Nursing Code of Ethics
4. **Ethical Principles**:
	- **Beneficence**: "*doing good*"; acting for the best interest of the patient.
	- **Non-maleficence**: "*avoiding evil*"; acting to protect the patient against harm.
	- **Autonomy**: allowing the patient to exercise self-determination and freedom from duress; protection of their independence.
	- **Privacy**: the right of the patient to be free from unjustified access by others.
	- **Confidentiality**: the protection of information, limited only to the healthcare team directly involved in patient care and those given authorization.
	- **Fidelity**: "*promise-keeping*"; the act of fulfilling all preordained and uptaken roles and responsibilities by the nurse.
	- **Veracity**: truthfulness and honesty, so long as the information will not result in harm to the patient.

# Contemporary Issues in Critical Care Nursing
1. **Informed Consent**: a legal contract indicating the well-informed and voluntary consent of an individual to undergo a procedure. It serves to protect the client against unauthorized procedures, and to protect the healthcare workers against legal action.
	- Explanation of procedures should include benefits, risks, alternatives, complete information and explanation for the procedure, where the patient is given ample opportunity to express concerns and inquiries.
	- No duress of any form should be placed upon the patient during the process of obtaining informed consent.
	- Patients must make decisions based on knowledge and understanding of  accurate and appropriate information **voluntarily**.
	- **To be able to give consent**, individuals must be both physically (18+) and mentally (Unaltered LOC, sane) matured.
	- **Right to Withdraw Consent** may be exercised.
	- **Substitutes** or **Proxy Consent** may be provided when the individual is not qualified to provide consent. These may be signed by parents, relatives, legal guardians, and the next of kin.
	- **In emergency situations** where the individual is not able to provide consent and no relatives are available, the healthcare provider decides on behalf of the patient in the best interests of preserving life.
	- **Right to Refuse** is always respected.
		- If refused, and there are no risks: **respect the decision**.
		- If refused, and there are risks: **explain the risk** to patients or relatives.
		- If the patient still refuses life-saving treatment or devices, sign a **Waiver**.
2. **Determining Capacity** reflects a medical decision on patient's ability to participate in the decision-making process of their healthcare.
3. **Advance Directives**: statements the patient wishes to be respected when their decision-making becomes impaired. This includes **Treatment Directives** or "**Living Wills**", which is a legal document that specifies treatment choices and interventions desired in advance; and **Proxy Directives**, which produces a durable power of attorney for the patient's health care.
4. **End-of-Life Care Issues**: end-of-life care is physical, emotional, social, and spiritual support for patients and their families. Its primary goal is to control pain and other symptoms to make the patient as comfortable as possible i.e. improve quality of life. Some issues include:
	- Decisions to forego life-sustaining treatments.
	- Nutrition and hydration
	- Pain management
	- Resuscitation decisions: Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) orders and Do Not Intubate (DNI) orders.
5. **Paternalism**: violation of the patient's autonomy by deciding on their behalf "*for their good*." Health care professionals believe they know what is best for the patient.

# Process of Ethical Analysis
1. **Assessment**: (1) identify the problem: clarify competing ethical claims, conflicting obligations, and personal and professional values; (2) gather data: distinguish morally relevant facts (medical, nursing, legal, social, psychological, religious, philosophical) and beliefs/values; (3) identify individuals involved in the problem's development and who should be involved in decision-making.
2. **Planning**: consider all options and plans. Be creative. Look into institutional policies and/or procedures that address the issue. Identify pros and cons for the approaches identified. Analyze if the plan follows ethical theories and principles.
3. **Implementation**: choose a plan and carry it out.
4. **Evaluation**: outline the results, identify harm or good consequences, and identify necessary adjustments in institutional policies or other strategies to avoid similar issues in the future.
