title: Care Bundles for Quality and Safety
---
**Care Bundles** are structures ways for improving care with small, straight-forward sets of [[B418/02-03#Evidence-Based Practice (EBP)|evidence-based practices]]. Often, it consists of only three to five elements to prevent morbidity and mortality. In this discussion, five common bundles will be discussed: the ventilator bundle, central line bundle, sepsis resuscitation bundle, sepsis management bundle, and catheter-associated urinary tract infection bundle.
___
# Ventilator Care Bundle
A care bundle mainly tackling **ventilator-associated pneumonia**. This type of pneumonia is one that occurs in a patient 48 hours after intubation with an endotracheal tube or tracheostomy tube, with no preceding signs and symptoms. It is the second most common healthcare-associated infection, occurring in 25% of intubated patients with a mortality rate of 13% to 55%.
>[!INFO] Bugs Causing VAP
>Early-onset VAP (<96 hours) is often caused by *Hemophilus influenza*, *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, and *Staphylococcus aureus*. Late-onset VAP (>96 hours) is often caused by *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, *Acinetobacter spp.*, and MRSA.
## Diagnostic Criteria for VAP
1. **New or progressive radiographic infiltrates** from a chest x-ray.
2. At least two of: (1) **fever >38°C**, (2) **leukocytosis** or **leukopenia**, and (3) **purulent secretions**
## Guidelines
1. **Elevation of the head of the bed** to improve breathing comfort, and minimizes microaspiration/aspiration of gastric, oral, and nasal secretions.
2. **Daily oral care with chlorhexidine** (0.12%) reduces the bacterial load in oral mucosa, lowering the risk for VAP.
3. **Daily sedation vacation**: the removal of sedation temporarily each day to determine the possibility of weaning off and extubation.
4. **PUD Prophylaxis**: raised gastric pH levels is conducive to bacterial growth. Risk of stress ulcers increase during mechanical ventilation. This may utilize proton pump inhibitors (PPI) and H₂ receptor blockers.
5. **DVT Prophylaxis**: a common problem in immobilized/bed-ridden patients. This may utilize mechanical therapy and anticoagulants (heparin, warfarin, -xabans)

Additional measures include the use of sub-glottic secretion drainage for ETTs, airway humidification, the use of closed suction systems (prevent aerosolization of pathogens), and ventilator circuit management (changing if soiled/per patient).
___
# Central Line Bundle
A **central line-associated blood stream infection** (CLABSI) is defined as a laboratory-confirmed bloodstream infection not related to an infection at another site that develops within 48 hours of central line placement.
