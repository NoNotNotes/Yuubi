 Electrocardiography (ECG/EKG) is the **graphic recording of the electrical activity (electric potentials) of the heart**. It is a noninvasive and affordable method of monitoring, often readily available in health care facilities. It uses **metal electrodes** attached to the extremities and chest wall to measure electric potential, which is then visualized by the ECG machine.

# Conduction System of the Heart
1. In normal physiology, the electrical impulse originates from the **sinoatrial node**, depolarizing the **right atrium**, being recorded as a **P wave**.
2. The impulse travels down to the **atrioventricular node**,
3. The **Bundle of His** continues the impulse, splitting into the **right and left bundle branches**.
4. Finally, the **Purkinje Fibers** are predominant carriers of impulse within the ventricles, travelling downward, turning at the apex of the heart to wrap around the myocardium upwards. The resulting ventricular contraction is seen as the **QRS Complex**.
5. Finally, the **T wave** is a sign of **ventricular repolarization**.
## Depolarization-Repolarization Cycle

| Phase                                 | Electrolyte Flow                                        |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Phase 0**: **Rapid Depolarization** | Sodium rapidly enters cardiac cells                     |
|                                       | Calcium slowly enters cardiac cells                     |
| **Phase 1**: **Early Repolarization** | Sodium channels close                                   |
|                                       | Potassium temporarily increases from efflux             |
| **Phase 2**: **Plateau Phase**        | Calcium continues to flow in                            |
|                                       | Potassium continues to flow out                         |
| **Phase 3**: **Rapid Repolarization** | Potassium channels open, rapid diffusion                |
|                                       | Calcium channels become inactivated                     |
| **Phase 4**: **Resting Phase**        | Sodium-Potassium pump returns Na and K to their states. |
|                                       | Cell membranes become impermeable to sodium ions.       |

# Lead Placement
The following are the corresponding leads to which wall of the heart is being detected:
- **II, III, AVF**: inferior wall
- **I, AVL**: lateral wall
- **V<sub>1</sub>, V<sub>2</sub>**: septal wall
- **V<sub>3</sub>, V<sub>4</sub>**: anterior wall
- **V<sub>5</sub>, V<sub>6</sub>**: lateral wall
- **AVR**: no specific view
>[!INFO] Coronary Artery Sources
>- The **Right Coronary Artery** supplies the inferior wall.
>- The **Left Coronary Artery** supplies the anterior, septal, and lateral walls.
## Unipolar Precordial Leads
1. **V<sub>1</sub>**: 4th ICS, Right Sternal Margin
2. **V<sub>2</sub>**: 4th ICS, Left Sternal Margin
3. **V<sub>3</sub>**: Midway between V<sub>2</sub> and V<sub>4</sub>
4. **V<sub>4</sub>**: 5th ICS, MCL
5. **V<sub>5</sub>**: AAL on the same level as V<sub>4</sub>
6. **V<sub>6</sub>**: MAL on the same level as V<sub>4</sub>
## Lead Axes
The two leads to consider for axis deviation is **Lead I** and **Lead AVF**. If both are positive, the axis remains normal.

| Lead I   | Lead AVF | Axis                   |
| -------- | -------- | ---------------------- |
| Positive | Positive | Normal                 |
| Positive | Negative | Left                   |
| Negative | Positive | Right                  |
| Negative | Negative | Extreme Axis Deviation |

# ECG Wave Parameters
An **electrocardiograph** is an axis of time (0.04 s per cell) and electrical potential (inc). These cells are grouped into a five by five larger square, spanning 200 milliseconds.
1. **P Wave**: atrial depolarization;  the time of atrial conduction. Normally 0.5 to 2.5 mm when graphed, and **up to 0.10s** in duration in adults.
	- **Rapid sequence of P waves** (sawtooth appearance) indicate **atrial flutter**, as the atrium rapidly depolarizes.
	- **Absence of P waves** is termed **atrial fibrillation**, when the heart fails to establish a meaningful contraction.
2. **PR Interval**: significant duration for detecting **heart block**, as it is the period of time for impulses to travel from the SA node to the ventricles. It is measured in limb leads with the longest PR. Normally **0.12 to 0.20 s** in adults, equivalent to 70 to 90 BPM.
3. **QRS Complex**: ventricular depolarization. Normally **0.06 to 0.10 s**, at least less than **0.12 s**.
4. **QT Interval**: Normally **less than 0.44 s**.
	- A prolonged QT interval can also result from heart block.
5. **ST Segment**: the period from the end of ventricular depolarization to atrial repolarization.
	- **ST segment elevation** is a characteristic finding for **myocardial infarction**.
	- **ST segment depression** is a sign of **myocardial ischemia**.
6. **T Wave**: atrial repolarization
>[!TIP] Heart Rate Calculation
>The formula $\text{HR}=1500/\text{\# of small squares}$ or 
$\text{HR}=300/\text{\# of big squares}$  can be used to determine the heart rate of an individual from an ECG reading.
