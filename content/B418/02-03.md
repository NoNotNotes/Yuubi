title: Ethical and Legal Considerations in Critical Care Nursing
---
Also read: [[CMPA/PALMER Reviewer]]
There are four **foundations for ethical decision making**:
1. **Professional Codes and Standards** e.g. the Philippine Nurse's Act (R.A. 9173), the Nuremberg Code, etc.
2. **Institutional Policies**
3. **Legal Standards** e.g. the Patient's Bill of Rights, the Nursing Code of Ethics
4. **Ethical Principles**:
	- **Beneficence**: "*doing good*"; acting for the best interest of the patient.
	- **Non-maleficence**: "*avoiding evil*"; acting to protect the patient against harm.
	- **Autonomy**: allowing the patient to exercise self-determination and freedom from duress; protection of their independence.
	- **Privacy**: the right of the patient to be free from unjustified access by others.
	- **Confidentiality**: the protection of information, limited only to the healthcare team directly involved in patient care and those given authorization.
	- **Fidelity**: "*promise-keeping*"; the act of fulfilling all preordained and uptaken roles and responsibilities by the nurse.
	- **Veracity**: truthfulness and honesty, so long as the information will not result in harm to the patient.

# Contemporary Issues in Critical Care Nursing
1. **Informed Consent**: a legal contract indicating the well-informed and voluntary consent of an individual to undergo a procedure. It serves to protect the client against unauthorized procedures, and to protect the healthcare workers against legal action.
	- Explanation of procedures should include benefits, risks, alternatives, complete information and explanation for the procedure, where the patient is given ample opportunity to express concerns and inquiries.
	- No duress of any form should be placed upon the patient during the process of obtaining informed consent.
	- Patients must make decisions based on knowledge and understanding of  accurate and appropriate information **voluntarily**.
	- **To be able to give consent**, individuals must be both physically (18+) and mentally (Unaltered LOC, sane) matured.
	- **Right to Withdraw Consent** may be exercised.
	- **Substitutes** or **Proxy Consent** may be provided when the individual is not qualified to provide consent. These may be signed by parents, relatives, legal guardians, and the next of kin.
	- **In emergency situations** where the individual is not able to provide consent and no relatives are available, the healthcare provider decides on behalf of the patient in the best interests of preserving life.
	- **Right to Refuse** is always respected.
		- If refused, and there are no risks: **respect the decision**.
		- If refused, and there are risks: **explain the risk** to patients or relatives.
		- If the patient still refuses life-saving treatment or devices, sign a **Waiver**.
2. **Determining Capacity** reflects a medical decision on patient's ability to participate in the decision-making process of their healthcare.
3. **Advance Directives**: statements the patient wishes to be respected when their decision-making becomes impaired. This includes **Treatment Directives** or "**Living Wills**", which is a legal document that specifies treatment choices and interventions desired in advance; and **Proxy Directives**, which produces a durable power of attorney for the patient's health care.
4. **End-of-Life Care Issues**: end-of-life care is physical, emotional, social, and spiritual support for patients and their families. Its primary goal is to control pain and other symptoms to make the patient as comfortable as possible i.e. improve quality of life. Some issues include:
	- Decisions to forego life-sustaining treatments.
	- Nutrition and hydration
	- Pain management
	- Resuscitation decisions: Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) orders and Do Not Intubate (DNI) orders.
5. **Paternalism**: violation of the patient's autonomy by deciding on their behalf "*for their good*." Health care professionals believe they know what is best for the patient.

# Process of Ethical Analysis
%% According to the American Association of Critical Care Nurses %%
1. **Assessment**: (1) identify the problem: clarify competing ethical claims, conflicting obligations, and personal and professional values; (2) gather data: distinguish morally relevant facts (medical, nursing, legal, social, psychological, religious, philosophical) and beliefs/values; (3) identify individuals involved in the problem's development and who should be involved in decision-making.
2. **Planning**: consider all options and plans. Be creative. Look into institutional policies and/or procedures that address the issue. Identify pros and cons for the approaches identified. Analyze if the plan follows ethical theories and principles.
3. **Implementation**: choose a plan and carry it out.
4. **Evaluation**: outline the results, identify harm or good consequences, and identify necessary adjustments in institutional policies or other strategies to avoid similar issues in the future.

# Quality & Safety in Critical Care
## Knowledge Translation
The application of research in nursing practice. It involves an effective and timely synthesis, exchange, and application of knowledge among researchers and users to capture the benefits of research.
## Evidence-Based Nursing
As a subdomain of evidence-based practice, this is the application of the best available evidence, often from research findings, into the clinical setting to ensure best practice.
>[!CITE] In a definition synthesized by Scott and McSherry, evidence-based nursing is:
>an ongoing process by which evidence, nursing theory, and the practitioners' clinical expertise are critically evaluated and considered, in conjunction with patient involvement, to provide delivery of optimum nursing care for the indiviudal.

Evidence-Based Nursing undergoes various steps:
1. **Ask Clinical Questions** via the PICOT format or the SPIDER tool.
	- **PICOT**: used to frame a clinical question
		- **Population**: characteristics, conditions, problems of the population
		- **Intervention**: what are the intervention, assessment, screening, treatment, or service delivery model being considered? What is the proposed intervention?
		- **Comparison**: what is the main alternative to the intervention, assessment, or screening approach?
		- **Outcome**: what do you want to accomplish, measure, or improve?
		- **Time frame**: how long will it take to reach the desired outcome?
	- **SPIDER**: a tool used when dealing with experiences rather than scientifically measurable data. It focuses more on the design rather than the intervention. These deal with samples rather than a patient or populations. It tends to be used for questions that begin with "*What are the experiences of...?*"
		- **Sample**: the group of participants
		- **Phenomenon of Interest**: what behaviors and experiences are being considered?
		- **Design**: how was the study devised and conducted?
		- **Evaluation**: the measurement of the outcome. This may not be strictly empirical.
		- **Research Type**: the method (qualitative, quantitative, mixed).
2. **Gather Evidence**
	- **Internal Evidence**: obtained directly from clients or institutions
	- **External Evidence**: obtained from scientific literatures, research databases, and the like. This utilizes meta-analysis.
3. **Assess the Evidence**: once articles are selected for review, rapid appraisal is done to determine the most relevant, valid, reliable, and applicable evidence for the clinical question.
	- Ask "*are the results of the study valid?*", "*What are the results and are they important?*", "*Will the results help me care for my patients?*"
	- **Internal Evidence**: does the study investigate a population similar to my client/s?
	- **External Evidence**: do my client/s respond to the intervention?
4. **Make Clinical Decisions**: synthesize the studies to determine if they produce similar conclusions, thus supporting EBP decisions or change. Evidence alone is not sufficient to justify a change in practice. Clinical expertise, based on patient assessments, laboratory data, data from outcomes of management programs, as well as patients' preferences and values are important components of EBP.
	- **Define** your clinical question.
	- **Extrapolate** any applicable information from external evidence.
	- **Consider** clinical expertise.
	- **Incorporate** the needs and perspectives of clients.
	- **Develop** assessment and treatment plans.
5. **Evaluate the clinical decision and its impacts**. Its results should be disseminated. This reduces needless duplication of effort and promotes evidence-based clinical approaches. Successful initiatives for dissemination includes presentations at local, regional, and national conferences; reports in peer-reviewed journals; professional newsletters; and publications for general audiences.

## Quality & Safety Monitoring
1. **Care Bundles**: a "bundle" is a group of 3 to 5 evidence-based interventions that, when performed together, have a better outcome that if performed individually. These can be used to ensure the delivery of the minimum standards of care. An example of this is the Sepsis Care Bundle, part of the International Surviving Sepsis campaign. It is the most widely utilized bundle.
	- These may be used as an audit tool to assess the delivery of interventions (though, not individually).
	- These encourage the review of evidence and modification of clinical care guidelines, engendering staff education in best practice.
	- Its **key principle** is the **high level of adherence to all components**.
2. **Checklists**
3. **Continuous Quality Improvement** (CQI)
4. **Plan-Do-Check-Act** (PDCA) **Cycle**, also known as the Deming Cycle or Shewhart Cycle, is a management tool for continuous improvement of a business's products or processes. It can be applied to standardize nursing management and thus improve the nursing quality and increase the survival rate of patients. Simply put, it is used to implement change, solve problems, and continuously improve nursing management processes. It provides continuous improvement because it is a **cyclical** process. The use of this model does not require much expertise and can be done with little to no training.
	- **Plan** the change or improvement to be made.
	- **Do**: perform a pilot test of the change.
	- **Check**: gather data about the change, ensuring it is successful.
	- **Act**: implement the change on a broader scale; continuing "Checking" and repeating the cycle as necessary.
	- **Advantages**: all appropriate steps are followed, improvement is systematized, provides an effective process improvement guide, informs future improvement by providing feedback, and maintains order during problem-solving.
	- **Disadvantage**: requires significant commitment over time
## Multidisciplinary Plans of Care
A *multidisciplinary plan of care* is a set of expectations for the **major components of care** a patient should receive during the hospitalization to manage a specific medical or surgical problem. It provides an interdisciplinary, comprehensive blueprint for patient care. The result is a diagnosis-specific plan of care that focuses the entire care team on expected patient outcomes.

This methodology benefits both the patients and the hospital system:
- Improves patient outcomes (e.g., survival rates, morbidity, quality of life)
- Increased quality and continuity of care
- Improved communication and collaboration
- Identification of hospital system problems
- Coordination of necessary services and reduced duplication
- Prioritization of activities
- Reduced length of stay and health-care costs

A multidisciplinary plan of care is developed by a team of individuals who closely interact with a specific patient population. This commonly includes physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists, physical therapists, social workers, and dietitians. Formats for multidisciplinary plans of care include:
- Discharge planning
- Discharge outcomes
- Patient goals
- Assessment and evaluation
- Consultations
- Tests
- Medications
- Nutrition
- Activity
- Education

Each of these may be divided into daily activities, or grouped into phases of hospitalization (pre-, -intra-, and postoperative phases). This plan of care optimizes communication, collaboration, coordination, and commitment to the pathway process.
