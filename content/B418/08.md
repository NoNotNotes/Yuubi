# Congestive Heart Failure
**Heart failure** is a condition in which the ventricles cannot pump forcefully enough to send blood out to meet the metabolic needs of the body. Certain conditions, such as narrowed arteries of the heart (coronary heart disease) or high blood pressure gradually degrade the heart's functioning. It can involve the left side (ventricle) of the heart (Left-Sided Heart Failure), right side (ventricle) of the heart, or both. However, in general, congestive heart failure begins with the left ventricle, which is the heart's main pumping chamber.
1. **Left-sided Heart Failure**: pulmonary circulation becomes congested, and fluid can back up into the lungs, causing **shortness of breath**. As the left side of the heart is ahead of the right side in circulation, it normally results in right-sided failure as well.
2. **Right-sided Heart Failure**: systemic circulation becomes congested, and fluid can back up into the abdomen, legs, and feet, causing swelling.
3. **Systolic Heart Failure**: the left ventricle **fails to contract** vigorously, indicating a **pumping problem**.
4. **Diastolic Heart Failure**: the left ventricle **fails to relax or fill** fully, indicating a **filling problem**.

Many conditions can contribute to heart failure. Many contributors are of modifiable lifestyle habits, such as diet, weight control, and vices:
1. **Hypertension**
2. **Diabetes Mellitus**
3. **Congenital Heart Defects**
4. **Lifestyle**: smoking, drinking
5. **Obesity**/**Overweight**
6. **Valvular Heart Diseases**

The nature of each type of heart failure changes their **manifestations**, as they affect different parts of the circulatory system. In congestion of both sides, both sets of manifestations can be found.
1. **Right-sided Heart Failure**: **congestion of peripheral tissues** results in edema (pedal, ascites), liver congestion (impaired liver function), and GIT congestion (anorexia, distress, weight loss).
2. **Left-sided Heart Failure**: **congestion of pulmonic circulation** results in **pulmonary congestion** (impaired gas exchange, pulmonary edema) which produce cyanosis, signs of hypoxia, coughing with frothy sputum, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. It also **decreases cardiac output**, which can product activity intolerance and signs of decreased tissue perfusion.
>[!INFO] Classification
>CHFs are commonly classified based on the **NYHA Functional Classification** or **AHA**/**ACC Staging System**.

**Treatment modalities** for patients with CHF include a reestablishment of normal oxygenation and circulation. This can be through pharmacologic, surgical, and nursing actions:
1. **Oxygenation**
2. **Pharmacologic Intervention**: inotropes (increases cardiac output), vasodilators, ACE inhibitors, diuretics (reduce fluid volume)
3. **Surgical Intervention**: pacemakers, mechanical heart pumps, or even heart transplants can be used if the heart of the patient is mechanically dysfunctional.
4. **Nursing Management** focuses on **preventive practices**. This may be done prior to, during, and after the diagnosis of congestive heart failure.
	-  **Maintenance of physical functioning**: promotion of cardiac wellness
	- **Adherence to treatment regimen**
	- **Weight monitoring** to detect fluid retention from congestion, as well as a monitor for obesity and overweight correction
	- **Diet and lifestyle modification**: mainly limitations on sodium intake, as it is a major electrolyte directly related to fluid volume. Other lifestyle modifications such as **smoking cessation** and **alcohol intake limitations** have high value as preventive measures.
	- **Rest Periods**: the decreased cardiac output predisposes the patient to activity intolerance. When planning activities, adequate rest periods should be provided in order to manage physical and mental stress.
	- **Blood Pressure Control**: in addition to pharmacologic intervention, high blood pressure can be corrected with lifestyle and diet changes.

If unmanaged, congestive heart failure can result in **kidney damage** or even failure due to reduced blood flow to the kidneys, **valvular problems** from cardiac enlargement or extreme pressure, **arrhythmias** and **dysrhythmias**, and **liver problems** from fluid buildup, placing pressure on the liver.
