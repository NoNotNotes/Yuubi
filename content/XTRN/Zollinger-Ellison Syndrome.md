**Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome** (ZES) is a rare digestive disorder which results in excessive activity of stomach acid, which can result in peptic ulcers along the stomach and intestinal linings. It is likely that this is caused by **gastrinomas**, which are endocrine tumors that produce the hormone **gastrin**, which is a stimulant for gastric juice production. These tumors are typically not cancerous tumors.
# Risk Factors
- Almost anyone can get ZES. However, genetic disposition with **Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1** (MEN1) may increase chances of **gastrinomas**.
- It is **more common in men**, often those from **30 to 50 years old**.
# Signs and Symptoms
- **Nausea and Vomiting**
- **Weight Loss**
- **Diarrhea**
- **Abdominal Pain** which may be "burning" in nature.
- **Severe Heartburn** (GERD)
- **Intestinal Bleeding** as shown by black, tarry, or bloody stool.
# Diagnostic Examination
![[19#Gastric Analysis|gastric analysis]]
- Blood testing to check for **serum gastrin levels**.
- Imaging tests may also be done for the gastrinomas.
# Medical Management
- [[Proton Pump Inhibitors]] can help manage extra stomach acid. This prevents the formation of ulcers.
	- Esomeprazole, Lansoprazole, Pantoprazole, Dexlansoprazole, Rabeprazole, Omeprazole.
- Removal of the tumors may be necessary. If severe, chemotherapy may be used.
# Complications
- Prognosis is not complicated, and only a few people become seriously ill. Ulcers are just about the last things to worry about with ZES.
