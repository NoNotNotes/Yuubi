## Urine Specific Gravity (1.005 - 1.030 kg/m³)
Measurement of the **concentration of solutes** in urine. A lower specific gravity is representative of urine with less solutes and vice versa.
## Depressions
- (**<1.004**) [[B316/07#Diabetes Insipidus|Diabetes Insipidus]], a lack of urine concentration due to inadequate [[Antidiuretic Hormone|ADH]].
	- May be a result of a transsphenoidal hypophysectomy for management of [[B316/05#Hyperpituitarism|hyperpituitarism]].
