Many relevant models in psychiatric nursing began with the Austrian physician **Sigmund Freud**. His theories have, over time, been improved by interpersonal and humanist models. They lacked in their initial purpose of etiologic explanation of mental illness, but became important in **the development of therapeutic relationships, techniques, and interventions**.
