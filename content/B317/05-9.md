title: Shared Psychotic Disorders
---
"*Folie a deux*" is an unusual mental disorder characterized by shared delusions among multiple individuals who are closely related. There is an "**inducer**" who influences another individual ("**induced**") with a specific belief. This may rarely cause delusions shared among large groups e.g. an entire family ("*Folie a familie*")

# Types
1. **Folie imposee** (Imposed Psychosis): transferred from one individual to another within an intimate relationship; abates once separated.
2. **Folie simultanee** (Simultaneous Psychosis): shared risk factors and genetic factors lead to simultaneous development of a shared psychosis.
3. **Folie communiqu√©e** (Communicated Psychosis): similar to *Folie Imposee*, but the induced is more resistant. The delusion will persist even after separation.
4. **Folie induite** (Induced Psychosis): the inducer continues to add delusions to the induced.
# Treatment and Management

	- Combination of **mood stabilizers** & **antipsychotics** or **antipsychotics** & **antidepressants**.
