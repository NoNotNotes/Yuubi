# Filipino Cultures, Values, and Practices
**Culture** is the summation of indigenous forces and foreign influences that had come to bear upon the people in varying degrees during the last centuries. **Values** refer to the set of values that a majority of the Filipino have historically held important in their lives. These guide what is "good", "useful", "beautiful", "desirable", and many more. **Traditions**, also called customs or practices, is a common way of doing things that are handed down from the past and to the future generation.
1. ***Utang na Loob***: a debt of one's inner self (*loob*); "*debt of gratitude*". It is an **obligation to appropriately repay a person who has done one a favor**. These involve a **deeply personal internal dimension**. In the Filipinos, this is a reflection of the *kapwa* orientation of shared personhood or shared self which is at the core of the Filipino value system.
2. ***Pakikisama***: a typical trait denoting "*getting along with others*". This entails a **genuine and intrinsic appreciation of togetherness, where harmony and unity is valued**. Individuals wish to get along rather than stand out, and leave no one behind.
3. ***Hiya***: translating to **shyness** or **shame**. It is related to pride, connecting to self-image or self-esteem. This may also describe **feelings of failure when one realizes they have violated the rules of conduct and expectations of society**.
4. ***Bahala Na***: "*leave it to God*"; the tendency to **leave things to a supreme force or nature**.
5. ***Amor Propio***: literally meaning "self-love", meaning **personal worth** similar to *hiya*, this is the sensitivity to **personal affront** or simply the **individual's self-esteem**. This is vulnerable to the way he is viewed by others, specifically in the area of **negative comments**.
