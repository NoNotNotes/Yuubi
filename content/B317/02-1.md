# Discover Your Johari Window
The Johari Window can be determined through the use of specific words from a set of adjectives.
1. **Choose Your Peers** who will be defining you.
2. **Define Yourself**: select five to ten words from the entire list (review all of the words first) that best describe you.
3. **Be Defined**: have all your peers do the same as you did in #2.
4. **Plot Definitions**
	- **Open**: words that both you and peers selected
	- **Hidden**: words that only you selected
	- **Blind**: words that only the peers selected
	- **Unknown** are the remaining words (or leave it empty). These behaviors may only emerge during times of crisis.
5. **Review the Window**: how aligned are your views and the others' views of you? How **open** are you as a person? What descriptions are you **blind** towards?

|The Words| | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Able|Accepting|Adaptable|Bold|Brave|
|Calm|Caring|Cheerful|Clever|Complex|
|Confident|Dependable|Dignified|Empathetic|Energetic|
|Extroverted|Friendly|Giving|Happy|Helpful|
|Idealistic|Independent|Ingenious|Intelligent|Introverted|
|Kind|Knowledgeable|Logical|Loving|Mature|
|Modest|Nervous|Observant|Organized|Patient|
|Powerful|Proud|Quiet|Reflective|Relaxed|
|Religious|Responsive|Searching|Self-Assertive|Self-Conscious|
|Sensible|Sentimental|Shy|Silly|Spontaneous|
|Sympathetic|Tense|Trustworthy|Warm|Wise|
|Witty| | | | |

6. **Changing Your Window**: most people should try to be more **open** and transparent with others about how they think and feel. This entails seeking more feedback from others, which reduces the size of the **blind** window. Making the **unknown** window may also be a goal, but is more difficult.
	- **Hidden**: what would you like to **share more about yourself**? How can you **show it to others**?
	- **Blind**: what would you **like to learn about how others perceive you**? What can you do to receive **better feedback**?
	- **Sharing**: share the completed window with peers and **let them know about your plans** to become more **open** and shrink your **blind** and **hidden** panes.
