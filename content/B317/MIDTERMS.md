## Major Depressive Disorder
- **Definition**: two or more weeks of a sad mood or a lack of interest in activities with at least four other symptoms of depression. This is the leading cause for worldwide disability, followed by [[#Bipolar Disorder]].
- **DSM-5 TR**: at least five symptoms displayed in a two-week period, representing differences from previous behavior
	- At least one of a generalized (a) depressed mood, and (b) loss of interest/pleasure
	- (1) significant appetite or weight loss or gain without organic causes, (2) insomnia or hypersomnia, (3) psychomotor retardation or agitation, (4) anergia or fatigue, (5) feelings of worthlessness, inappropriate guilt, (6) Inability to decide or concentrate, and (7) recurrent thoughts of death (ideation, planning, attempt)
- **Onset**: occurs at most ages, and may last up to years (20% become chronic), but often clears within 6 months. Recurrence is seen in 50% to 60% of patients.
- **Incidence**: twice as common in women except during the prepubertal age where the rates even out between sexes. As age increases, female rates decrease and male rates increase.
    - Having first degree relatives with depression increases rates by 1.5 to 3 times.
    - Being single and divorced produces the highest rates of depression.
- **Symptoms**: anhedonia, alterations in weight, sleep, energy, concentration, decision-making, self-esteem, and goals. Psychosis may be found in severe cases of depression. Hopelessness and helplessness are proportional to the degree of depression.
- **Theories**:
    - Neurochemical Imbalance: decreased norepinephrine and serotonin as a result of inadequate secretion, their reuptake being too fast, and dysfunction or decreased amounts of the postsynaptic receptors. SSRIs inhibit reuptake, and antidepressants improve postsynaptic receptor sensitivity.
### Treatment/Management
- **Psychopharmacology**: Cyclic Antidepressants, Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs), Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), and Atypical Antidepressants
	- **SSRIs** take full effect in 10 days. **Fluoxetine** (**Prozac**) produces less somnolence and has a shorter half-life than other SSRIs.
	- **Cyclic Antidepressants** (TCA) are the oldest antidepressants. They block norepinephrine and serotonin, and increase postsynaptic receptor site sensitivity. These take 10 to 14 days before reaching a therapeutic serum level, and six weeks to take full effect. These are cheaper. Contraindicated for severe liver impairment and the acute recovery phase of myocardial infarction. Should also be cautiously used for patients with glaucoma, benign prostatic hypertrophy, urinary retention/obstruction, diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, renal impairment, or respiratory disorders due to its anticholinergic effects.
	- **Atypical Antidepressants** are used if SSRIs are ineffective. These include **Venlafaxine** (**Effexor**) among others. Part of this is the Esketaime (Spravato) Nasal Spray that is a Schedule III controlled substance. Patients receive and stay in the clinic for 2 hours after administration due to severe side effects.
	- **Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors** e.g. **Isocarboxazid** (**Marplan**) may have potentially fatal side effects, and have numerous interactions with other drugs or food, most fatally resulting in a **hypertensive crisis** when combined with **tyramine-rich foods**. **Selegiline** (**Emsam, Eldepryl, et.al**) is a transdermal patch MAOI with lower risks for a hypertensive crisis. MAOIs have a 2 to 4 week lag period, and should be given time to discontinue before changing medications.
	- Antipsychotics are used for acute depression that produce psychotic symptoms.
	- Antidepressants have recently been studied to prevent recurrences by increasing the duration of prescription by 3 to 6 months longer than previously done. Tapering the dosage instead of discontinuing it may also be effective in decreasing relapses.
- **Electroconvulsive Therapy** (ECT) is still being studied, but has been effective. It is used for patients unresponsive to antidepressants, pregnant patients, high suicide risk patients, and psychotic patients. Sessions are done from six to fifteen (12 - 15 is best) treatments thrice a week. Short-acting anesthetics and muscle relaxants are given.
	- Grand mal seizures, disorientation, confusion, headaches, and short-term memory loss may occur.
	- NPO is required after midnight, fingernail polish is removed, and the patient voids before the procedure.
	- Monitor for the return of the gag reflex.
### Nursing Care
1. **History**: subjective, objective, and from family members or significant others.
	- Assess client perception of the problem by asking about behavioral changes they are aware of (onset, duration, factors involved, and actions taken). Previous episodes and treatment is important.
	- Determine family history for mood disorders and (attempted) suicide.
2. **MSE**: psychomotor retardation or agitation, anhedonia, anergia, apathy, depressed or flat affect, withdrawing, negativism, pessimism, rumination, psychosis (persecutory delusions), suicidal thought (often readily admitted). Command hallucinations may induce suicide. Memory, focus, attention, and judgment are impaired. Insight may be intact or limited. Self-esteem is low, feelings of worthlessness, helplessness and hopelessness are found. Self-care and social roles/functions are impacted.
3. **Assessment Priorities**:
	- Risk for suicide
	- Inadequate nutrition: food and fluids
	- Anxiety, Hopelessness, Low Self-esteem
	- Ineffective Coping, Self-care Deficits
	- Disrupted, poor-quality sleep
	- Impaired social interaction
4. **Diagnosis**: **==Ineffective coping==**
	- Expected Outcomes:
		- **Immediate**: free from self-inflicted harm (immediate), engaged in reality-based interaction (24 hours), oriented to three spheres (48 to 72 hours), safe expression of anger and hostility (5 to 7 days)
		- **Stabilization**: express feelings with directly congruent verbal and nonverbal messages, free from psychotic symptoms, and demonstrate functional level of psychomotor activity.
		- **Community**: demonstrate compliance with and knowledge of medications, increased ability to cope with negative feelings, and identify support systems within their community.
5. **Nursing Actions**:
	- ==**Safety**==: physical safety to prevent self-destructive actions.
	- ==**Suicide watch**==: continuous assessment and awareness of suicide potential (thought, intent, plan).
	- **Observation** especially during initiation of medication (increased energy), limited or unstructured periods of activity, and changes in behavior, related to suicide awareness.
	- **Reorientation** to the three spheres: inform the client of their name, the place, and the time. Presentation of reality is concrete reinforcement for the client.
	- **Spend time with the client**. Your physical presence is reality.
		- Develop a **therapeutic relationship**. For example: "*I'm Nurse K. I'll be your nurse for today. I'll be here for a few minutes. If you need anything or if you want to talk, please tell me*". After time has passed, "*I'm going now. I'll be back in an hour to see you again.*"
	- **==Tackle Rumination==**. Limit attention given to ruminations, and talk about reality or about the client's feelings. Reinforcement allows for reality orientation and is encouraged by expressing feelings.
	- **Maintaining staff assignments** for patients facilitates familiarity and trust, but the number of people interacting with the patients should increase when possible to minimize dependency.
	- **Moderate-level tone** of voice (not overly cheerful) allow the client to be comfortable with their emotions; being cheerful may cause them to think that cheerfulness is the goal, and their feelings are incorrect. Being talkative may also overwhelm the client and cause them to withdraw from talking.
	- **Silence and active listening** facilitates communication of interest and concern. Allow the client to know that they are not *required* to talk, and silence is okay.
	- **Keep It Short and Simple**; the client's perception of complex stimuli may be impaired.
	- **Avoid questioning**, especially questions that only require short answers. These may discourage expression by the client.
	- **==Do not belittle or undermine the patient's feelings==**. Accept and support the client's verbalizations of feelings. Do not cut off interactions with cheerful remarks or platitudes if you feel discomfort during conversation.
	- ==**Support expression**== of any form by the client, and let them know you are ready to listen and accept their expressions. Remain nonjudgmental.
	- **Allow and encourage the client to cry**. Provide privacy or remain with the client if they desire and if it is safe to do so. It is among the healthiest forms of expression for sadness, hopelessness, and despair.
	- **Do not probe for information**. **Allow the client to discuss what they are comfortable with**. This may discourage communication and cause discomfort.
	- **Discuss coping strategies** that the client has used, looking for successful and unsuccessful results. Teach the client about **positive coping strategies**, **stress management skills**, and **problem-solving processes** (e.g. exploring options, examining consequences, using alternatives, evaluating results), which may also be a source of **success and positive feedback** if practiced in the clinical environment. Assist the patients in choosing, using, and changing strategies and provide the patient with **positive feedback** for each step of the process.
	- **Promote ADLs and Physical Care**. These are related to levels of psychomotor retardation. Ask the patient to perform global tasks first to assess their ability, then break the task into smaller segments if they are unable to comply. Use success in small steps to increase self-esteem and competency.
		- For example, the nurse may choose articles of clothing for the patient if they are unable to do so themselves e.g. "*Here are your gray slacks. Put them on*". If they are still unable to comply, "*Let me help you put on your slacks, M.*". Let the patient do as much as possible for themselves.
		- The nurse may acknowledge the client's feelings while still promoting participation: "*I know you feel like staying in bed, but it is time to get up for breakfast.*"
	- **Establish adequate nutrition and hydration**. Smaller, more frequent feedings can avoid overwhelming the client. Staying with the client and monitoring intake can promote and may be necessary for patients until they are consuming adequate amounts.
	- **Promote sleep**: short-term sedatives and avoiding staying in bed during the day improve sleep duration and quality. Note length and whether the client feels refreshed when awakening.
	- **Manage Medications**: MAOIs and antidepressants may be fatal when overdosed, so only a one-week supply should be given to the patient if overdosing is a concern. Increased energy and mood after the initiation of medication may give the patient the energy required for suicide. Maintain watch. Inform the patient of side effects and to verbalize any if they experience them, and inform the patient of how often monitoring and diagnostic examination is required.
6. **Outcome Evaluation**:
	- The client will not injure themself.
	- The client will independently carry out ADLs.
	- The client will establish a balance of rest, sleep, and activity.
	- The client will establish a balance of adequate nutrition, hydration, and elimination.
	- The client will evaluate self-attributes realistically.
	- The client will socialize with staff, peers, and family/friends.
	- The client will return to occupation or school activities.
	- The client will comply with antidepressant regimen.
	- The client will verbalize symptoms of a recurrence.
## Bipolar Disorder
- **Definition**: Extreme mood swings from episodes of **mania** to episodes of **depression** (hence its previous name of "*manic-depressive illness*). **Manic episodes** produces euphoria, grandiosity, high energy, and sleeplessness. Poor judgment, rapid thoughts, action, and speech are manifested. **Depressive episodes** manifest the same as major depressive episodes (also read: [[#Major Depressive Disorder]]), and may result in an incorrect diagnosis of depression until an episode of mania occurs. A questionnaire for this mood disorder can be found [here](http://www.sadag.org/images/pdf/mdq.pdf). It is the second leading cause of worldwide disability, following the major depressive disorder. It may be classified according to degrees of manic or depressive episodes:
	- **Bipolar Manic**: person experiencing cycles of mania and normal behavior.
	- **Bipolar Depressed**: person experiencing cycles of depression and normal behavior.
	- **Bipolar Mixed**: person experiencing cycles of mania and depression.
	- **Bipolar Type I**: bipolar manic, but with at least one depressive episode.
	- **Bipolar Type II**: bipolar depressed, but with at least one hypomanic episode.
- **DSM-5 TR** for Manic Episodes and Bipolar I Disorder
	- A manic episode must occur, where a distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated/expansive/irritable mood and goal-directed activity or energy lasts for at least one week. During the period of mood disturbance, at least three of the following must be present: (1) grandiosity/inflated self-esteem, (2) decreased sleep requirements, (3) being talkative/pressured speech, (4) flight of ideas, "*racing thoughts*", (5) distractibility, (6) goal-directed hyperactivity e.g. socially, occupational, academic, sexual or psychomotor agitation (purposeless activity), and (7) excessive involvement in risky activities.
	- A hypomanic or major depressive episode must also occur before or after the manic episode.
- **Onset**: first manic episodes often occur between the teens and 30s, typically suddenly and rapidly escalating symptoms over a few days. Manic episodes are often shorter than depressive episodes.
- **Incidence**: almost equal between sexes, and is more common in highly educated people. Adolescents display psychosis more commonly than other age groups.
- **Symptoms**: depression and thought of suicide may occur especially in young men and recently discharged, alcoholics, or previously suicidal individuals.
### Treatment/Management
- **Psychopharmacology**: a lifetime regimen of medications is required. An **antimanic agent** (lithium) or **anticonvulsant medications as mood stabilizers** are used.
	- **Lithium** is a salt in the body found in trace amounts. In acute mania, lithium is effective in 70% to 80% of cases. It can "*mute*" and **reduce the frequency and degree of manic and depressive episodes**, potentially even eliminating manic episodes entirely. Its mechanism of action is unknown, but is thought to hasten catecholamine destruction, inhibit the release of neurotransmitters, and decrease postsynaptic receptor sensitivity.
		- Peaks in **30 minutes to 4 hours**, or 4 to 6 hours in slow-release forms. The onset of action is 5 to 14 days, with its half-life being 20 to 27 hours.
		- Affects other ions (calcium, magnesium, potassium) and glucose metabolism.
		- ==**Contraindicated in renal disease**==.
	- **Anticonvulsants**, whose mechanism of action is also unknown, has been theorized to raise the sensitivity of the brain to stimulants, which decreases or prevents mania.
		- **Carbamezapine** (**Tegretol**) was the first anticonvulsant to serve as a mood stabilizer, but risk for agranulocytosis requires regular serum level checking for therapeutic levels (~4 to 12 mcg/mL) or toxic levels. A baseline and periodic laboratory testing monitors for white blood cell supression.
		- **Valproic Acid** (**Depakote**) also requires regular monitoring (therapeutic levels are 50 to 125 mcg/mL) as well as liver function tests (ammonia levels, platelet and bleeding times).
		- **Clonazepam** (**Klonopin**) is only used in conjunction with lithium or other mood stabilizers, and may result in physiological dependence.
		- Antipsychotic medications (Abilify, Geodon, Seroquel) may also be combined with mood stabilizers or antidepressants to prevent a switch from a depressive to a manic episode.
	- **Antipsychotics** are used if psychotic symptoms are displayed.
- **Psychotherapy** may be used during normal portions or mildly depressive portions of the bipolar cycle (not in acute mania, as minimal benefit is gained due to impaired concentration and insight). This may also reduce suicide risk.
### Nursing Care
1. **History**: obtaining data during mania is difficult; short sessions may be required. Data from family members may be required. Valuable information may be obtained through observation.
2. **MSE**: psychomotor agitation; "*perpetual motion*" that results in exhaustion or injury. Clothing may reflect mania. Thinking, moving, and speech are fast. **Pressured Speech** is a hallmark symptom. Euphoria, exuberant activity, grandiosity, and a false sense of well-being is felt. Projection of an all-knowing and all-powerful image may be used to defend against low self-esteem. Mood may be labile and alternate between tears and laughter. Thought is confused and jumbled, with a flight of ideas. They are unable to connect concepts, and thinking is circumstantial and tangential. Judgment is impaired, and actions reflect this in mania (spending, travelling, sexual activity). Psychosis (grandiose delusions) may occur. Concentration and attention is highly impaired. They are easily angered and irritated by "censorship" from others. They do not perceive and problems with their behavior and often blame others. These clients have a great need to socialize, but fail to do so. Their false sense of well-being can result in days of sleeplessness or starvation. They may destroy or throw away valued items.
3. **Assessment Priorities**:
	- Risk for violence
	- Risk for unintended injury
	- Inadequate nutrition: food and fluids
	- Ineffective coping
	- Noncompliance
	- Unable to fulfill roles
	- Self-care deficits
	- Low self-esteem
	- Inadequate rest and sleep.
4. **Diagnosis**:
5. **Nursing Actions**:
	- **==Ensure Safety==**: provide a safe environment for clients and others. Monitor for suicidal or violent thoughts, ideation, or planning.
	- **Establish control**: which may be external, done so with a nonjudgmental and empathetic attitude. If boundaries are invaded, limits should be set when the clients are not able to set limits on themselves e.g. "*You are too close to my face. Please stand back two feet.*" or "*It is unacceptable to hug other clients. You may talk to others, but do not touch them*". Clearly identify the unacceptable behavior and the expected, appropriate behavior. All staff should enforce consistent limits.
	- **Reorient the client** to the three spheres. Repeated presentation of reality provides concrete reinforcement for the client.
	- **Consistency **
	- **==Meet Physiological Needs==**: decrease environmental stimuli, establish a (bedtime) routine, finger-foods high in protein and calories that can be eaten quickly are ideal, but some may be inadequate. Snacks in between meals can also be useful. Sleep, food, and fluids are monitored until regularly met. Taking food from others should be prevented.
	- **Therapeutic Communication**: clear, simple sentences is used for short attention span and impaired understanding. Asking the client to repeat brief sentences can ensure understanding. 
		- Short explanations for laboratory tests allay anxiety. Printed information for tests, rules, schedules, rights, treatment, staff names, and client education can help reinforce verbal messages. 
		- The client's disordered speech requires an open channel of communication for clients from the nurses, regardless of speech pattern. Moving the responsibility for difficulty in communication to the nurse helps reduce client anxiety"*Please speak more slowly. I'm having trouble following you.*"
		- Pressured speech may cause "competition" for the nurse's attention. Talking one-on-one avoids this problem. Setting limits on talking and listening is done.
	- **Promoting Appropriate Behaviors**: restlessness may be directed into socially acceptable, large motor activities such as arranging chairs for a community meeting or walking. In acute mania, the nurse may need to limit the client (social, sexual, financial) until their mania abates.
	- **Managing Medications**: lithium levesl (therapeutic: 0.8 - 1.5 mEq/L, maintenance: 0.5 - 1 mEq/L) toxicity (>1.5 mEq/L) manifests as N&V, diarrhea, ataxia, drowsiness, slurred speech, muscle weakness, hypertonicity, altered level of consciousness, or coma. etc.. The client and family should be informed of symptoms, and levels should be regularly checked.
		- High salt intake can reduce lithium receptor availability and increase lithium excretion. Adequate water intake should be monitored as well, as increased fluid intake dilutes and reduces lithium levels, and decreased water intake increases lithium levels. Daily weighing of the patient is done to monitor for shifts in fluid balance. Any conditions that can cause dehydration should be reported.
		- Renal status is checked as lithium is not metabolized, and is excreted in the urine. As such, lithium is contraindicated in patients with reduced renal function, urinary retention, and when taken with low-salt diets or diuretics. Brain or cardiovascular damage is also contraindicated.
		- Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels may elevate or depress in patients taking lithium.
	- **Client and Family Education**: the illness, symptoms, potential problems, and treatments are discussed with the client and family. Providing education about courses of action to take allows significant others to have "permission" to intervene with behaviors. Medication dosages, symptoms, and considerations for toxicity should be discussed.
6. **Outcome Evaluation**:
	- The client will not injure self or others.
	- The client will establish a balance of rest, sleep, and activity.
	- The client will establish adequate nutrition, hydration, and elimination.
	- The client will participate in self-care activities.
	- The client will evaluate personal qualities realistically.
	- The client will engage in socially appropriate, reality-based interactions.
	- The client will verbalize knowledge of their illness and treatment.
