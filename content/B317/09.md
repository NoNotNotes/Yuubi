It is often harder to diagnose psychiatric disorders in children due to limited communication, lacking abstract cognitive abilities, variable behaviors between age groups, and ego-syntonicity.
___
# Autism Spectrum Disorder
**ASD** (prev. *autism*, *autistic disorder*) is composed of various **pervasive developmental disorders** (PDD; *Rett's Disorder, Childhood Disintegrative Disorder, Asperger's Syndrome*) characterized by pervasive and often severe impairment of reciprocal social interaction skills, communication deviance (hard-to-follow forms of communication), and restricted stereotypical (repetitive) behavioral patterns.
- **ASD** is five times more prevalent in boys than girls. It is often identified by 18 months of age, no later than 3 years.
- 80% of children with autism experience early onset (<1 year), with the remaining 20% normally displaying routine development followed by regression during the 2nd to 3rd year of life.
- Autism has a genetic link, with many children having relatives with ASD or other autistic traits.

Children with ASD have **persistent deficits** in communication and social interaction accompanied by restricted and stereotyped patterns of behavior and interests/activities.
- These children **minimally utilize communication techniques** such as eye contact, facial expressions, and gestures. Intelligible speech may also be reduced.
- They may experience **reduced spontaneous enjoyment and affect**. They may not engage in play or in make-believe with toys.
- They may display **stereotyped motor behaviors** such as hand-flapping, body twisting, or head-banging.
- Deficits in communication due to ASD may improve, sometimes substantially, as the use of language and communication techniques develop. Behavior may deteriorate during adolescence due to hormonal changes. Complex social demands arise, leaving individuals dependent on others possibly until adulthood.
## Autism Disorders
1. **Autism**, also known as mindblindedness. A developmental disorder of variable severity ==characterized by **difficulty in social interaction and communication** and by **restricted stereotyped thought and behavior**==.
	- **Onset, Incidence, and Etiology**: often identified within the one year of age, and not later than 3 years. More common in boys than girls (5:1). Etiology is mostly unknown except for a genetic link and mechanical trauma during the birth process.
	- **Characteristic**: impairment of reciprocal interaction skills
	- **Manifestations**:
		- **Difficulty in Social Interactions**: unaffectionate, asocial, inappropriately attached to objects, lack of interest in the environment, inappropriate laughter or giggling, and avoidance of eye contact
		- **Difficulty with Communication**: underdevelopment of language; the use of gestures rather than language, and other difficulties in expression.
		- **Stereotypical Behavior** (SPAN)
			- Sustained repetitive motor movements e.g. spinning objects or the self, rocking, hand or finger flapping, body twisting, etc.
			- Preference of same-ness or having a routine: preoccupation with lights, moving objects, or parts of objects.
			- Apparent insensitivity to pain
			- No real fear of dangers
	- **Diagnosis**: assessment of any **developmental delays** in the first two years of life
		- **12 months**: no babbling, pointing, or gesturing
		- **18 months**: no single word spoken
		- **24 months**: no two-word spontaneous expressions
	- **Management**:'
		- Reduction of **behavioral symptoms**:
			- Temper tantrums, aggressiveness, self-injury, hyperactivity, and stereotyped behaviors: **Haloperidol** (Haldol), **Risperidone** (Risperdal)
			- Diminish self-injury and hyperactive and obsessive behaviors: **Catapres** (Clonidine), **Anafranil** (Clomipramine), and **ReVia** (Naltrexone).
		- Promote **learning and development**: special education focused on development of social skills, language, self-care, and academic performance.
		- **Family Therapy**: parental education
2. **Rett's Disorder**: a ==**regressive** pattern of development== **after a period of normal functioning** from birth to **5 months of age**.
	- **Onset, Incidence, and Etiology**: more common in girls (4:1). Etiology is unknown.
	- **Characteristic**: devolution of development from birth to five months of age.
	- **Manifestations**: **stereotyped behavioral patterns** (headbanging, tantrums, body twisting), **loss of expressive** (explaining) **and** **receptive** (understanding) **language**, and **loss of interest in the social environment**.
	- **Differentials from Autism**:
		- More common in girls rather than boys
		- Loss of previously acquired language rather than maldevelopment
		- Loss of hand function vs. preserved hand function
		- **Presence of ataxia** and **seizures** are common
		- **Abnormal chewing ability**
		- **Delayed physical growth**
3. **Asperger's Disorder**: milder symptoms of autism; ==**social challenges and unusual (stereotyped) behaviors** or interests are still present, but **problems with language or intellectual disability is absent**==. Individuals may have normal IQ or **even potentially exhibit exceptional skill or talents in specific areas**.
	- **Onset, Incidence, and Etiology**: later onset, more common among boys, with an unknown but potentially genetic etiology.
	- **Characteristic**: severe impairment of social interactions with stereotyped behaviors. IQ may be preserved with exceptional talent in specific areas.
	- **Manifestations**: severe impairment in social interaction, and marked problems with empathizing and modulating social relationships.
	- **Management**: social skills training
4. **Childhood Disintegrative Disorder**, also known as **Heller's Syndrome** and **Dementia Infantialis**. This involves ==**marked regression** in multiple areas of functioning after at least **two years** of normal growth and development==. Regression may be gradual or rapid (within 6 to 9 months).
	- **Onset, Incidence, and Etiology**: onset between 3 and 4 years of age, being more common in boys.
	- **Manifestations**:
		- **Stereotyped behavioral patterns** e.g. headbanging, tantrums, body twisting
		- **Loss of previously acquired spoken language**
		- **Loss of previous acquired social skills**
		- **Loss of motor functions** e.g. continence
___
# Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
A neurodevelopmental type mental disorder characterized by difficulty in paying attention, excessive activity, and acting without regards to consequences, which are otherwise not appropriate for a person's age i.e. **==hyperactivity, inattentiveness, distractibility and impulsivity==**. This condition is often identified and diagnosed at the beginning of preschool.
- **Incidence**: more common among boys
- **Risk Factors**: poor familial socioeconomic status, harmony, treatment (neglect, abuse), or parental deprivation; low birth weight; family history of ADHD
- **Symptoms** (mn. ADHD)
	- **Academic Performance** is poor
	- **Development  of Relationships** is strained; behavior is disruptive and intrusive at home and during conversation, causing friction with family and peers.
	- **Hyperactivity and Impulsivity**: restlessness (can't sit still, fidgets), excessive talking, running, and climbing, and being interruptive in conversation.
	- **Difficulty sustaining attention and concentration**
		- Not appearing to listen, **missing details**, **easily distracted**
		- Makes **careless mistakes** in school works, **avoids mentally difficult tasks**
		- **Unable to organize** and misplaces objects
		- **Attention span** can range from 2 to 3 minutes (mild) to 2 to 3 seconds (severe)
## Treatment
1. **Psychopharmacology** (mn. CARDS)
	- **Cylert** (Pemoline): hepatotoxic, and therefore the last drug to be prescribed.
	- **Adderal** (Amphetamine)
	- **Ritalin** (Methyphenidine)
	- **Dexedrine** (Dextroamphetamine): may cause insomnia, anorexia, weight loss, irritability, and risk for self-injury.
	- **Strattera** (Atomoxetine): a non-stimulant antidepressant (SSRI) drug. May cause anorexia, nausea and vomiting, fatigability, and abdominal distress.
2. **Other Drugs**
	- **Tricyclic Antidepressants**
	- **Alpha-2 Agonists**: Clonidine and Guanfacine
	- **Traditional antipsychotic drugs** may be used to manage severe impulsiveness
# Nursing Interventions
1. **==Ensure safety==** for the client and others: stop unsafe behaviors, provide supervision, and give clear instructions about acceptable and unacceptable behavior.
2. **==Improve role performance==**: allow the client to accomplish tasks easier by **modifying the environment** (remove distractions), **gain the child's full attention**, **simplifying instructions** and **breaking complex tasks down into simpler tasks**, allowing for **breaks**, and providing **positive feedback** for meeting expectations.
3. **Structured daily routine**: establish a daily schedule and minimize changes.
4. **Client and family education and support**: listen to parents' feelings and frustrations.

# Related Neurodevelopmental Disorders
## Tic Disorders
Tics are sudden, rapid, recurrent, non-rhythmic, stereotyped movement or vocalization. Tics can be suppressed but not indefinitely. These are exacerbated by stress and abated by focus. Tic disorders tend to run in families, with **dopamine** potentially being implicated in tic disorders ergo the use of atypical  neuroleptics e.g. **risperidone** (**Risperdal**) and **aripiprazole** (**Abilify**) for treatment.
 Read also: [[Tourette's Disorder]]
- **Motor Tics**: blinking, neck-jerking, shrugging, grimacing, and coughing.
- **Complex Motor Tics**: facial gestures, jumping, touching or smelling an object.
- **Vocal Tics**: clearing the throat, grunting, sniffing, and snorting.
- **Complex Vocal Tics**: **coprolalia**, socially unacceptable speech e.g. expletives, **palilalia**, repeating one's own words or sounds, and **echolalia**, repeating others' words or sounds.
### Classification (DSM-5)
1. **Transient Motor or Vocal Tic Disorder**: (1) at least one vocal or motor tics (but not both) (2) occurring every day, or nearly every day, for at least two weeks (3) that does not last longer than 12 consecutive months.
2. **Motor or Vocal Tic Disorder**: (1) rapid, recurrent, uncontrollable movements or vocal outbursts (but not both) (2) nearly every day for more than a year or every day for more than 3 months.
3. **Tourette's Disorder**: (1) multiple motor tics and at least one vocal tic (2) occurring for multiple times a day, nearly every day, or intermittently for more than a year (3) that results in academic, social, and occupational functioning. The disorder is identified before 7 years of age, and is more common in boys.
## Learning Disorders
An on-going problem in the areas of **reading** (dyslexia), **mathematics** (dyscalculia), or **written expression** (dysgraphia), performing below what is expected for the individual's age, formal education, and intelligence (DSM-5).
- May result in **low self-esteem** and **poor social skills**, and **problems with employment or social adjustment** are experienced as adults.
- **Management**: early detection, **special education**, and intervention minimize difficulties and provide better outcomes.
1. **Dyslexia** is difficulty with reading and connecting letters to the sounds they make. Reading becomes slow, effort, and fails to become a fluent process.
2. **Dysgraphia** is difficulty with expressing one's thoughts onto writing. This may include difficulty in spelling, grammar, punctuation, and handwriting.
3. **Dyscalculia** is difficulty in learning number-related concepts or using symbols and functions to perform calculations. Number sense, math-related memorization, mathematical reasoning, and mathematical problem-solving may be impacted.
## Motor Skills Disorders
1. **Developmental coordination disorder** features **==impaired coordination severe enough to interfere with ADLs and academic achievement==**. The condition becomes evident when the child **attempts to crawl, walk, manipulate toys and building blocks, or dress themselves**. It may also accompany a communication disorder. This diagnosis is only made if it is not a part of general medical conditions such as cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, or other degenerative disorders (DSM-5).
	- **Symptoms**: unable to perform age-appropriate skills e.g. buttoning buttons, catching a ball, or an elementary school child struggling with writing or sports. Planning and memorization of motor patterns is impaired.
	- **Management**: **special physical education** (gym activities) for special needs **promotes hand-eye coordination** and **motor development** to improve specific skills.
2. **Stereotypic movement disorder** features rhythmic, repetitive, involuntary behaviors for a period no less than four weeks (DSM-5). Its onset begins prior to 3 years of age and continues into adolescence. This non-functional behavior may result in self-injury.
	- Handwaving, rocking, headbanging, biting fingernails or self for no apparent reason, or picking at the hair or skin like in trichotillomania and dermatillomania. Self-inflicted injuries are commonly associated with this disorder as **pain fails to deter the behavior**.
	- Comorbid conditions such as anxiety, ADHD, OCD, and Tourette's/tics become the **source of functional impairment** more than the stereotypic behavior.
	- Behavioral therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may be used to help with stereotypic movement disorder.
## Communication Disorders
Language consists of **receptive** (receiving and understanding language) and **expressive** (production of language) skills and ability. Difficulty in these speech, language, and communication may be a result of communication disorders. Diagnosed when deficits become severe enough to hinder development, academic achievement, or ADLs/socialization. **==Speech therapy==** is offered for individuals with these disorders.
1. **Language disorders** pertains to deficits in language production or comprehension across various linguistic modalities (spoken, written, sign language, etc.); (1) limited vocabulary, (2) inability to form sentences, and (3) impairment in discourse or conversation.
	- **Expressive Language Disorder** produces an inability to use verbal and non-verbal language for communication: **limited speech**, **incomplete/incorrect use of words or sentences**, and **difficulty in learning new words** (mn. LID)
	- **Mixed Expressive-Receptive Language Disorder** is characterized by the same problems with expressive language, with the addition of **difficulty in understanding and determining the meanings of words and sentences**. This may be developmental or acquired from neurologic or brain injury.
2. **Speech sound disorder** pertains to difficulty in producing intelligible speech not secondary to congenital or acquired conditions. This difficulty causes limitations in social, academic, and/or occupational performance.
	- A **phonologic** disorder causes difficulty in articulation sourced from the mind i.e. inability to understand the sounds of a language.
	- An **articulation** disorder causes difficulty in articulation due to the physical production of speech sounds.
3. **Social (pragmatic) communication disorder** involves the persistent difficulty in using verbal and nonverbal communication in social contexts; a diagnosis is made after observation of all of the following: (1) the inability to **observe societal norms** for conversation and context, (2) inability to **tell a cohesive story**, (2) not following **rules of conversation** such as taking turns talking and listening to others, and (3) inability to **make inferences** e.g. humor, figurative speech, double meanings, etc.
4. **Stuttering** pertains to a disturbance in fluency and patterning of speech with repetitions of sounds and syllables.
## Elimination Disorders
Children with elimination disorders are often continent by adolescence. Only 1% of cases persist into adulthood. Associated impairment depends on limitation of social activity due to the condition, effects on self-esteem, ostracism by peers, and punishment or angry responses of caregivers or parents.
1. **Encopresis** is the repeated passage of feces inappropriately e.g. in bed, in pants, on the floor by a child at least **4 years of developmental or chronological age**. This may either be **involuntary** (often associated with psychological constipation) or **intentional** (often associated with oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder).
2. **Enuresis** is the repeated voiding of urine inappropriately during the day or at night by a child at least **5 years of developmental or chronological age**. This is most often **involuntary**, but can be voluntary (related to disruptive behavior disorder). It is usually unaccompanied by other mental disorders. 75% of children with enuresis have a first-degree relative who have had enuresis. 
### Treatment
- **Enuresis**: **imipramine** (Tofranil), an antidepressant with urinary retention as a side effect. **Desmopressin** (Nocdurna, DDAVP), an antidiuretic hormone, may also be used.
- **Elimination disorders related to disruptive behavior disorders** may be resolved with **psychological treatment** of the disorder. Both forms of elimination disorders respond to **behavioral approaches** e.g. pads with warning bells and **positive reinforcement** for continence.
## Intellectual Disability Disorders
Intellectual disability, also known as mental retardation, is characterized by below-average intelligence or mental ability and a lack of skills necessary for day-to-day living. There are two areas affected by these disorders: **Intellectual Functioning**, also known as IQ, referring to the ability to learn, and **Adaptive Behaviors**, skills necessary for day-to-day life such as being able to communicate effectively, interact with others, and take care of oneself.
- The **Intelligence Quotient** (IQ) is measured via a test, with an IQ of 100 being the average. An IQ of 70 or less is considered to be intellectually disabled.
### Classification
1. Mild to Moderate Intellectual Disability
2. Severe Intellectual Disability
3. Profound Intellectual Disability

| Classification     | IQ         | Characteristic          |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ----------------------- |
| Mild; Moron        | 70 to 50   | Educable                |
| Moderate; Imbecile | 50 to 35   | Trainable               |
| Severe; Idiot      | 35 to 20   | Needs Close Supervision |
| Profound           | 20 or less |                         |

[Intellectual disability](https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/intellectual-disability-mental-retardation) (ID), once called mental retardation, is characterized by below-average intelligence or mental ability and a lack of skills necessary for day-to-day living. People with intellectual disabilities can and do learn new skills, but they learn them more slowly

- Someone with intellectual disability has limitations in two areas. These areas are:

9.1.        Intellectual functioning. Also known as IQ, this refers to a person’s ability to learn, reason, make decisions, and solve problems.

9.2.         Adaptive behaviors. These are skills necessary for day-to-day life, such as being able to communicate effectively, interact with others, and take care of oneself.

- IQ (intelligence quotient) is measured by an IQ test. The average IQ is 100, with the majority of people scoring between 85 and 115. A person is considered intellectually disabled if he or she has an IQ of less than 70 to 75.

1. Mild                         50 – 70            educable                                (Moron)

2. Moderate                 35 – 50            trainable                                  (Imbecile)       

3. Severe                    20 – 35            needs close supervision         (Idiot)                                     

4. Profound                 20 below          need custodial care

- Mild to Moderate Intellectual Disability

The majority of people with ID are classified as having mild intellectual disabilities. Individuals with mild ID are slower in all areas of conceptual development and social and daily living skills. These individuals can learn practical life skills, which allows them to function in ordinary life with minimal levels of support. Individuals with moderate ID can take care of themselves, travel to familiar places in their community, and learn basic skills related to safety and health. Their self-care requires moderate support.

- Severe Intellectual Disability

Severe ID manifests as major delays in development, and individuals often have the ability to understand speech but otherwise have limited communication skills ([Sattler, 2002](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK332877/)). Despite being able to learn simple daily routines and to engage in simple self-care, individuals with severe ID need supervision in social settings and often need family care to live in a supervised setting such as a group home.

- Profound Intellectual Disability

Persons with profound intellectual disability often have congenital syndromes ([Sattler, 2002](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK332877/)). These individuals cannot live independently, and they require close supervision and help with self-care activities. They have very limited ability to communicate and often have physical limitations. Individuals with mild to moderate disability are less likely to have associated medical conditions than those with severe or profound ID.

- Signs and symptoms seen in children with intellectual disability

Signs may appear during infancy, or they may not be noticeable until a child reaches school age. It often depends on the severity of the disability. Some of the most common signs of intellectual disability are:

> Rolling over, sitting up, crawling, or walking late

> Talking late or having trouble with talking

> Slow to master things like [potty training](https://www.webmd.com/parenting/guide/potty-training-when-to-start), dressing, and feeding himself or herself

> Difficulty remembering things

> Inability to connect actions with consequences

> Behavior problems such as explosive tantrums

> Difficulty with problem-solving or logical thinking

- Principles of care

1.    Repetition

2.    Role modeling

3.    Restructuring the environment

- Treatment and management

1. Treatments that address or mitigate any underlying cause of ID, such as restricting phenylalanine in the diet of patients who have phenylketonuria;

2. Treatments of comorbid physical and mental disorders with the aim of improving the patient's functioning and life skills, such as targeted pharmacologic treatments of behavioral disorders among children with fragile X syndrome ([Hagerman and Polussa, 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK332877/));

3. Early behavioral and cognitive interventions, special education, habilitation, and psychosocial supports
