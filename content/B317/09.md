# Autism Spectrum Disorder
**ASD** (prev. *autism*, *autistic disorder*) is composed of various **pervasive developmental disorders** (PDD; *Rett's Disorder, Childhood Disintegrative Disorder, Asperger's Syndrome*) characterized by pervasive and often severe impairment of reciprocal social interaction skills, communication deviance (hard-to-follow forms of communication), and restricted stereotypical (repetitive) behavioral patterns.
- **ASD** is five times more prevalent in boys than girls. It is often identified by 18 months of age, no later than 3 years.
- 80% of children with autism experience early onset (<1 year), with the remaining 20% normally displaying routine development followed by regression during the 2nd to 3rd year of life.
- Autism has a genetic link, with many children having relatives with ASD or other autistic traits.

Children with ASD have **persistent deficits** in communication and social interaction accompanied by restricted and stereotyped patterns of behavior and interests/activities.
- These children **minimally utilize communication techniques** such as eye contact, facial expressions, and gestures. Intelligible speech may also be reduced.
- They may experience **reduced spontaneous enjoyment and affect**. They may not engage in play or in make-believe with toys.
- They may display **stereotyped motor behaviors** such as hand-flapping, body twisting, or head-banging.
- Deficits in communication due to ASD may improve, sometimes substantially, as the use of language and communication techniques develop. Behavior may deteriorate during adolescence due to hormonal changes. Complex social demands arise, leaving individuals dependent on others possibly until adulthood.
## Autism Disorders
1. **Autism**, also known as mindblindedness. A developmental disorder of variable severity ==characterized by **difficulty in social interaction and communication** and by **restricted stereotyped thought and behavior**==.
	- **Onset, Incidence, and Etiology**: often identified within the one year of age, and not later than 3 years. More common in boys than girls (5:1). Etiology is mostly unknown except for a genetic link and mechanical trauma during the birth process.
	- **Characteristic**: impairment of reciprocal interaction skills
	- **Manifestations**:
		- **Difficulty in Social Interactions**: unaffectionate, asocial, inappropriately attached to objects, lack of interest in the environment, inappropriate laughter or giggling, and avoidance of eye contact
		- **Difficulty with Communication**: underdevelopment of language; the use of gestures rather than language, and other difficulties in expression.
		- **Stereotypical Behavior** (SPAN)
			- Sustained repetitive motor movements e.g. spinning objects or the self, rocking, hand or finger flapping, body twisting, etc.
			- Preference of same-ness or having a routine: preoccupation with lights, moving objects, or parts of objects.
			- Apparent insensitivity to pain
			- No real fear of dangers
	- **Diagnosis**: assessment of any **developmental delays** in the first two years of life
		- **12 months**: no babbling, pointing, or gesturing
		- **18 months**: no single word spoken
		- **24 months**: no two-word spontaneous expressions
	- **Management**:'
		- Reduction of **behavioral symptoms**:
			- Temper tantrums, aggressiveness, self-injury, hyperactivity, and stereotyped behaviors: **Haloperidol** (Haldol), **Risperidone** (Risperdal)
			- Diminish self-injury and hyperactive and obsessive behaviors: **Catapres** (Clonidine), **Anafranil** (Clomipramine), and **ReVia** (Naltrexone).
		- Promote **learning and development**: special education focused on development of social skills, language, self-care, and academic performance.
		- **Family Therapy**: parental education
2. **Rett's Disorder**: a ==**regressive** pattern of development== **after a period of normal functioning** from birth to **5 months of age**.
	- **Onset, Incidence, and Etiology**: more common in girls (4:1). Etiology is unknown.
	- **Characteristic**: devolution of development from birth to five months of age.
	- **Manifestations**: **stereotyped behavioral patterns** (headbanging, tantrums, body twisting), **loss of expressive** (explaining) **and** **receptive** (understanding) **language**, and **loss of interest in the social environment**.
	- **Differentials from Autism**:
		- More common in girls rather than boys
		- Loss of previously acquired language rather than maldevelopment
		- Loss of hand function vs. preserved hand function
		- **Presence of ataxia** and **seizures** are common
		- **Abnormal chewing ability**
		- **Delayed physical growth**
3. **Asperger's Disorder**: milder symptoms of autism; ==**social challenges and unusual (stereotyped) behaviors** or interests are still present, but **problems with language or intellectual disability is absent**==. Individuals may have normal IQ or **even potentially exhibit exceptional skill or talents in specific areas**.
	- **Onset, Incidence, and Etiology**: later onset, more common among boys, with an unknown but potentially genetic etiology.
	- **Characteristic**: severe impairment of social interactions with stereotyped behaviors. IQ may be preserved with exceptional talent in specific areas.
	- **Manifestations**: severe impairment in social interaction, and marked problems with empathizing and modulating social relationships.
	- **Management**: social skills training
4. **Childhood Disintegrative Disorder**, also known as **Heller's Syndrome** and **Dementia Infantialis**. This involves ==**marked regression** in multiple areas of functioning after at least **two years** of normal growth and development==. Regression may be gradual or rapid (within 6 to 9 months).
	- **Onset, Incidence, and Etiology**: onset between 3 and 4 years of age, being more common in boys.
	- **Manifestations**:
		- **Stereotyped behavioral patterns** e.g. headbanging, tantrums, body twisting
		- **Loss of previously acquired spoken language**
		- **Loss of previous acquired social skills**
		- **Loss of motor functions** e.g. continence
## Related Disorders
1. **Tic Disorders**: tics are sudden, rapid, recurrent, non-rhythmic, stereotyped movement or vocalization. Tics can be suppressed but not indefinitely. These are exacerbated by stress and abated by focus. Read also: [[Tourette's Disorder]]
	- Blinking, neck-jerking, shrugging, grimacing, coughing, clearing the throat, grunting, sniffing, snorting, **coprolalia** (socially unacceptable speech; expletives), **palilalia** (repeating one's own words or sounds), **echolalia** (repeating others' words or sounds), facial gestures, jumping, touching or smelling an object.
	- Tends to run in families, with dopamine potentially being implicated in tic disorders.
	- Treated with the atypical antipsychotics **risperidone** (Risperdal) or **aripiprazole** (Abilify).
2. **Learning Disorders**: ability in reading, mathematics, or written expression below that expected for age. Low self-esteem and poor social skills are common, and problems with employment or social adjustment are experienced as adults. Early detection and special education and intervention minimize difficulties and provide better outcomes.
3. **Motor Skills Disorders**:
	- **Developmental coordination disorder** features impaired coordination severe enough to interfere with ADLs and academic achievement. The condition becomes evident when the child attempts to crawl, walk, manipulate toys and building blocks, or dress themselves. It may also accompany a communication disorder. This diagnosis is only made if it is not a part of general medical conditions such as cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy. Special physical education intervenes with special needs and difficulties.
	- **Stereotypic movement disorder** features rhythmic, repetitive, behaviors such as handwaving, rocking, headbanging, and biting for no apparent reason. Self-inflicted injuries are commonly associated with this disorder as pain fails to deter the behavior. Its onset begins prior to 3 years of age and continues into adolescence. Comorbid conditions such as anxiety, ADHD, OCD, and Tourette's/tics become the source of functional impairment more than stereotypic behavior.
4. **Communication Disorders**: deficits in speech, language, and communication. Diagnosed when deficits become severe enough to hinder development, academic achievement, or ADLs/socialization. Speech therapy is offered for individuals with these disorders.
	- **Language disorder** pertains to deficits in language production or comprehension; limited vocabulary, inability to form sentences, and to converse.
	- **Speech sound disorder** pertains to difficulty in producing intelligible speech.
	- **Stuttering** pertains to a disturbance in fluency and patterning of speech with repetitions of sounds and syllables.
	- **Social communication disorder** involves the inability to observe societal norms for conversation and context, inability to tell a cohesive story, and inability to take turns talking and listening to others.
5. **Elimination Disorders**: children with elimination disorders are often continent by adolescence. Only 1% of cases persist into adulthood. Associated impairment depends on limitation of social activity due to the condition, effects on self-esteem, ostracism by peers, and punishment or angry responses of caregivers or parents.
	- **Encopresis** is the repeated passage of feces inappropriately e.g. in bed, in pants, on the floor by a child at least **4 years of developmental or chronological age**. This may either be **involuntary** (often associated with psychological constipation) or **intentional** (often associated with oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder).
	- **Enuresis** is the repeated voiding of urine inappropriately during the day or at night by a child at least **5 years of developmental or chronological age**. This is most often **involuntary**, but can be voluntary (related to disruptive behavior disorder). It is usually unaccompanied by other mental disorders. 75% of children with enuresis have a first-degree relative who have had enuresis. 
	- **Enuresis** is treated with **imipramine** (Tofranil), an antidepressant with urinary retention as a side effect. **Desmopressin** (Nocdurna, DDAVP), an antidiuretic hormone, is also used to treat enuresis. Elimination disorders related to disruptive behavior disorders may be resolved with psychological treatment of the disorder. Both forms of elimination disorders respond to behavioral approaches e.g. pads with warning bells and positive reinforcement for continence.
